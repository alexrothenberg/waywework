It was a great way to quickly implement type-ahead Ajax behavior by writing little or no code. By simply adding two lines – one to my controller:\n<pre>auto_complete_for :group, :name</pre>\n\nand another to my form:\n<pre>&lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :group, :name, {}, {:method => :get} %&gt;</pre>\n\nusers of my form were able to easily pick from a long list of group names simply by typing the first few letters. What I love about Rails is not only was I able to implement this complex feature with only 2 lines, but those 2 lines were very easy to read: my controller has to handle “autocompletion for group names” and my form should contain a “text field with auto complete behavior for group names”. It’s very natural and intuitive.\n<p />\n<p>The only ugly detail here is that the “{:method => :get}” hash is required to avoid errors related to form security… without it I get an error like this:</p>\n<pre>ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken):\n /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.1.1/lib/action_controller/request_forgery_protection.rb:86:in \'verify_authenticity_token\'</pre>\n\n<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-spinoffs/browse_thread/thread/7ed6dbb6bdcabf40/287a90ed28bba7da\">This discussion explains</a> that we can avoid the security exception by forcing the autocomplete request to use GET instead of POST. Note that you also need to change config/routes.rb to map the GET request for the completion values to the autocomplete action in your controller. This is a bit ugly, but not a big deal.\n\n<p />\n<p>However, once I tried adding additional fields to the form I ran into some real trouble. I enhanced my form by adding multiple child model objects; in this case I associated a series of people for each group. That is:</p>\n<pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base`\n belongs_to :group</pre>\n\nand:\n<pre>class Group &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n has_many :people</pre>\n\nFollowing <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/73\">Ryan Bates’ great explanation on railcasts</a> about how to implement a form for both parent and child records at the same time, I ended up with a form that looked like this:\n<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n Group &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :group, :name, {}, {:method =&gt; :get} %&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;% for person in @group.people %&gt;\n &lt;% fields_for \"group[person_attributes][]\", person do |person_form| %&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n Person &lt;%= person_form.label :name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :person, :name, {:index =&gt; nil}, {:method =&gt; :get} %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;% unless person.new_record? %&gt;\n &lt;%= person_form.hidden_field :id, :index =&gt; nil %&gt;\n &lt;% end %&gt;\n &lt;% end %&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>\n\nThis looks a lot more complicated, but except for the “index => nil” hack (see <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/75\">part 3 of Ryan’s screen cast</a> for an explanation) the code is very clean and straightforward to understand. We display the group name autocomplete text field as before, and then iterate over the people contained in this group, displaying a new autocomplete text field for each one.\n\n<p /><p>Too bad it doesn’t work! Even worse, this code actually has 3 separate problems:\n\nFirst, the &lt;input&gt; tag generated by text_field_with_auto_complete is not what we want for the child objects. Without autocomplete, we would use:\n<pre>&lt;%= person_form.text_field :name %&gt;</pre>\n\nreferring to the “fields_for” method just above and get this HTML:\n<pre>&lt;input id=\"group_person_attributes__name\" name=\"group[person_attributes][][name]\" size=\"30\" type=\"text\" /&gt;</pre>\n\nBut text_field_with_auto_complete :person, :name, … yields this instead:\n<pre>&lt;input id=\"person__name\" name=\"person[][name]\" size=\"30\" type=\"text\" /&gt;</pre>\n\nalong with CSS and Javascript for the auto complete behavior.\n\n<p /><p>Second, the server side code added to my controller also doesn’t know where to look for the person name value in the actual parameter hash; instead it assumes it will receive the parameter as specified in the &lt;input&gt; above: params[“person”][“name”]. See vendor/plugins/autocomplete/lib/auto_complete.rb for details.</p>\n\n<p /><p>And the last and worst problem of all is that the DHTML/Javascript code inside of controls.js from script.aculo.us assumes that the &lt;input&gt; tag id passed in will be unique on the page. But since we will have many person fields for each group field, the script.aculo.us code will fail trying to location the &lt;input&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags specified by text_field_with_auto_complete.</p>\n\n<p /><p>So what to do? The first time I solved this problem, I simply copied and hard coded the HTML and Javascript produced by the autocomplete plugin into my form erb file. Then I changed it to make it work. I also manually added a function to my controller on the server side to get it to find and process the parameter hash properly. If I were still writing PHP code, then I would probably assume this was sufficient and call it a day. If I happened to be using J2EE for this project, I’d probably look at creating a subclass of the autocomplete plugin somehow and extending/modifying the behavior as necessary. Then I would have yet another class and another JAR file to maintain and worry about – not quite as messy, but still ugly or at best complicated.</p>\n\n<p /><p>There must be a better way! Since I’m using Ruby I don’t need to settle for overly complicated code or ugly code. Instead I’ll try to develop a solution using what seems to me the Ruby philosophy: write the cleanest, tightest code you can that makes sense and then find a way to make it work. In my next post I’ll tell you what happened.</p>\n ', '2008-10-27 23:40:53')[0m

Once again I expected this to be a very easy task but ended up spending hours debugging and troubleshooting Mephisto and my blog setup on HostingRails.com.\n\nI started by downloading the theme onto my server:\n<pre>cd themes/site-1/\nmkdir cutline\ncurl http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/download?theme\n	=cutline.mephisto-themes.nanorails.com > cutline/cutline.zip\ncd cutline\nunzip cutline.zip</pre>\n\nNow when I logged into the Mephisto console and viewed Design->Manage Themes I saw the new theme. The first problem occurred when I clicked on the new theme and selected “Use Theme.\" I expected to see the new theme or a message in the admin console, but instead got a page full of text:\n<pre>$(\"dialog-box\").update(\"\\u003Cdiv id=\\\"theme-info\\\" class=\\\"clearfix\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Ch3\\u003E\\n Cutline (rhtml) (v1.1)by \\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"http://cutline.tubetorial.com/\\\"\\u003EPearsonified\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n \\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" id=\\\"close-dialog\\\" onclick=\\\"Dialog.close();\nreturn false;\\\"\\u003Eclose\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n \\u003C/h3\\u003E\\n \\u003Cdiv id=\\\"screenshot\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Cimg\nsrc=\\\"/admin/themes/preview_for/cutline\\\" alt=\\\"Theme preview\\\" title=\\\"Cutline (rhtml) (v1.1)\\\" /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cp\\u003EToday, you can put\nan end to boring default styling and step into a world where your posts will become more artistic, more engaging, and more\ncompelling!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n \\u003C/div\\u003E\\n \\u003Cdiv id=\\\"theme-options\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Cul\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/themes/change_to/cutline\\\"\\u003EUse theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/design?theme=cutline\\\"\\u003EEdit theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/themes/export/cutline\\\"\\u003EDownload theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\"\nonclick=\\\"if (confirm(\'Are you sure you wish to delete this theme stored at \\\\\'themes/site-1/cutline\\\\\'?\')) { new\nAjax.Request(\'/admin/themes/destroy/cutline\', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:\'delete\'}); }; return false;\\\"\\u003EDelete\ntheme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n \\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\");\nDialog.current.layout();</pre>\n\nIt looks like the parent window from the admin console was redirected to “/admin/themes/show/cutline” and the meta data/contents of the theme dialog box intended for some javascript was displayed as plain text to me. After staring at this for a while I started looking for help on the Internet and eventually found an article explaining that I needed to make a code change to app/controllers/admin/themes_controller.rb near line 5:\n\n<pre>before_filter :protect_action, :only => [:export, :change_to, :rollback,\n :import]</pre>\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n<pre>before_filter :protect_action, :only => [:export, :rollback]</pre>\n\n<p>One to do item here is to check whether the latest, edge version of Mephisto contains this fix already or not. I’m sure it does. Even after making the change on hostingrails.com I struggled for some more time before realizing that I had to kill any dispatch.fcgi processes running on the server before a code change would take effect. This wasn’t a problem in my local, development setup. Passenger must load and cache Ruby code after the first request. This would be interesting to explore further.</p>\n\n<p>I tried again and this time: success! Finally I was able to switch to the new theme. Excited, I quickly took a look at my new site and saw... nothing! More troubleshooting revealed this error in my production.log file:</p>\n\n<pre>SystemExit (Define INLINEDIR or HOME in your environment and try again):\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:93:in \'abort\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:93:in \'rootdir\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:107:in \'directory\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:277:in \'so_name\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:317:in \'load_cache\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:653:in \'inline\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/image_science-1.1.3/lib/image_science.rb:84\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:32:in \'gem_original_require\'\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:32:in \'require\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:496:in \'require\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:342:in \'new_constants_in\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:496:in \'require\'\n...plugins/attachment_fu/lib/technoweenie/attachment_fu/processors/image_science_processor.rb:1\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:27:in \'gem_original_require\'\netc...</pre>\n\nSome further searching on the Internet revealed that the problem here was that an image library called <a href=\"http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ImageScience.html\">ImageScience</a> requires something called <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinline\">RubyInline</a>. Looking at the stack trace, it seems that the “attachment_fu” plugin uses the ImageScience library. Probably this is used by Mephisto to produce the thumbnail preview images in the Admin->Assets page. The solution in this case is to create a folder on the server for RubyInline, and to set this value near the top of Mephisto’s environment.rb file. Along with my change from last week to force the production environment, the top of config/environment.rb looks like this:\n\n<pre># Uncomment below to force Rails into production mode when\n# you don\'t control web/app server and can\'t set it the proper way\nENV[\'RAILS_ENV\'] ||= \'production\'\nENV[\'INLINEDIR\'] ||= \'inline\'</pre>\n\nI tried again to see my site, and this time still saw a blank page. View->Source revealed that the Ruby code in the view was not being executed. Finally I installed the “mephisto_erb_templates” plugin as instructed by <a href=\"http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/2007/3/21/cutline-theme\">http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/2007/3/21/cutline-theme</a>.\n\n<pre>script/plugin install http://svn.nanorails.com/plugins/mephisto_erb_templates/</pre>\n\nNow the theme worked properly. I made a few cosmetic CSS tweaks, picked my own image and ended up with this page.\n ', '2008-10-27 23:40:53')[0m

Last week I setup this web site using <a href=\"http://mephistoblog.com/\">Mephisto</a> on a Rails hosting service (<a href=\"http://www.hostingrails.com/\">hostingrails.com</a>), and expected to get it up and running in just a few minutes; after all, if installing and configuring a PHP blog site in 2005 was easy, certainly doing the same in 2008 with better technology (Rails) should be even easier.</p>\n\n<p>Wrong!</p>\n\n<p>First I created a MySQL database on my production server and called it “mephisto”. Then I set the char set and collation settings using the command line:<pre># mysql -u myusername -p\nmysql> ALTER DATABASE mydatabasename DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8\n COLLATE utf8<em>unicode</em>ci</pre></p>\n\n<p>Since I’m not ready to write my own Rails blog site, I decided to download and setup the latest version of <a href=\"http://mephistoblog.com/download\">Mephisto (0.8 “Drax”)</a>. When I tried to download the TAR file from the 0.8 Drax link using curl I got HTML that redirected me to a different location:</p>\n\n<pre># cat master.tar.gz\n&lt;html>&lt;body>You are being &lt;a href=\"http://github.com/tarballs/technoweenie-\nmephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\">redirected&lt;/a>.&lt;/body>&lt;/html></pre>\n\n<p>Probably this is standard behavior by github and I should have used that directly. I need to stop thinking like a PHP developer! Regardless, it wasn’t much trouble to download the actual Mephisto TAR file:</p>\n\n<pre># curl -O http://github.com/tarballs/\n technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\n# tar xvf technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\n# mv technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa mephisto</pre>\n\n<p>No big deal; so far this was a very similar experience to setting up a PHP web site: create the database, download the code and you’re almost done. Next, I entered the proper values in database.yml and tried to initialize the database:</p>\n\n<pre># rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production\n(in /home/myusername/mephisto)\nYour config/boot.rb is outdated: Run \"rake rails:update\".</pre>\n\n<p>It was at this point that my problems started. First I wasn’t sure why I received this error message at all. Next I tried to use rails:update to fix it as instructed and ran into further trouble. A couple of hours and 5 or 10 blog posts later I discovered the solution <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/MephistoBlog/browse_thread/thread/a03e8ac350382e0e\">here in this great write up</a>. It turns out that Mephisto 0.8 does not work with Rails 2.1 and I needed to downgrade to Rails 2.0.2. Since I’m using a shared server on hostingrails.com I used rails:freeze:edge to get the proper version of Rails installed in my app’s folder:</p>\n\n<pre># rake rails:freeze:edge RELEASE=2.0.2\nDownloading Rails from http://dev.rubyonrails.org/archives/rails_2.0.2.zip\nUnpacking Rails\nUpdating current scripts, javascripts, and configuration settings</pre>\n\n<p>At this point I tried to initialize the database again but this time got a different error:</p>\n\n<pre># rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production\n(in /home/myusername/mephisto)\nrake aborted!\nundefined method \'install_gem_spec_stubs\' for #&lt;Rails::Initializer:0xb7c652e8></pre>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/MephistoBlog/browse_thread/thread/a03e8ac350382e0e\">explained here</a>, I still had to manually copy one file from Rails to my application which rails:freeze:edge didn’t handle properly, using this command from my app\'s folder:</p>\n\n<pre># cp vendor/rails/railties/environments/boot.rb config/boot.rb</pre>\n\n<p>Finally I was able to run rake db:bootstrap successfully! The last bit of configuration I had to do was to add this line to config/environment.rb in order to insure hostingrails.com used the production configuration:</p>\n\n<pre># Uncomment below to force Rails into production mode when\n# you don\'t control web/app server and can\'t set it the proper way\nENV[\'RAILS_ENV\'] ||= \'production\'</pre>\n\n<p>After creating a symlink and doing some other <a href=\"http://www.hostingrails.com/forums/wiki_thread/1\">standard configuration for hostingrails.com</a>, I was finally able to get my site up and running. It was a lot harder than configuring a PHP site and ruined a whole evening, but in the end wasn’t all that bad.</p>\n ', '2008-10-27 23:40:53')[0m

It’s a great way to get an interactive, community web site such as a blog or discussion forum up and running quickly without writing any code. But Drupal is a poor choice for general, complex web application development for a few simple reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn’t use a standard, general software architecture such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) like Rails or Struts.</li>\n<li>Drupal doesn’t employ or support modern development best practices such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a> or automated testing more generally. (Exception: the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/simpletest\">SimpleTest</a> module can provide some automated integration testing using HTTP without opening a real browser.)</li>\n<li>While the module API does allow for some customization, it can be easy to get into trouble if your target application is outside of Drupal’s design center. Specifically, you may end up having to modify Drupal’s core code or database schema when Drupal doesn’t behave the way you would like.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A better choice for more general or complex web development would be Ruby on Rails.</p>\n\n<p>If you do need to develop a custom web application using the Drupal framework, you can avoid problems #2 and #3 by using a test driven approach. Instead of simply implementing your custom logic by writing PHP code to the Drupal module API, try pulling your custom code out of Drupal entirely and running it independently of the framework. This will insure that your custom code could someday be run with another web framework and also help you avoid the temptation of modifying Drupal’s core code directly. Of course, you will also get all of the normal benefits of TDD: better design oriented around business requirements, live documentation through executable code, etc.</p>\n\n<p>How to do this? Write tests first using PHPUnit (which fail), then get your tests to pass by implementing the desired behavior using PHP 5 objected oriented code. Lastly, write a “shell” module that calls out to your test driven object oriented PHP code from Drupal. This means your code will be run twice: once from the command line by PHPUnit during development and from your CI process, and again from Drupal to process end user requests in production.</p>\n\n<p>In a series of future posts I\'ll write a Drupal module using TDD, using a few tips and tricks along the way to get PHPUnit and Drupal to play together nicely.</p>\n ', '2008-10-27 23:40:53')[0m

Meaning Class A does not depend on how class b is implemented and so on. In a system, YAGNI would manifest itself when a developer would want provide some type of feature that they feel the business will eventually need OR introduce a measure of complexity just for \"when\" things change drastically.\n</p>\n<p>\nI think the simplest example would be factories for the creation of every different type in a system\n(I am not sure why many have such a desire to abstract a constructor)\n\nAt this point YAGNI (if it were a person) would say stick to the simplest code to implement the task and do only what the users/business ask for.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut we can still designing a system for the future without requiring additional complexity by:\n<ul>\n<li>narrowing down interfaces and responsibilities of class</li>\n<li>Creating Behavior in a way so that it can be leveraged in other contexts</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\nSo what does that mean, lets take an example of Filtering an collection of object based on some criteria\n\nLets say we have a filter class that should filter items based on its location. It can filter anything that implements IsupportLocationFiltering\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportLocationFiltering\n{\n State GetState();\n}\n\n\nclass FilterRule\n{\n private readonly State TargetState;\n\n public IList Filter(IList itemsToFilter)\n {\n IList filteredItems = new ArrayList();\n foreach(IsupportLocatinFiltering supporter in itemsToFilter)\n	if(items.GetState() == TagetState) filteredItems.Add(supporter)\n return filteredItems;\n }\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe above FilterRule breaks encapsulation and therefore is not designed for the future. The reason being is the filter asks for the State and proceeds to compare it against the state that we want to find items from. First we are assuming that all types that implement ISupportLocationFiltering can be filtered by matching states. Maybe we match states for all objects today but tomorrow what if we introduce a new type that can support \"Location Filtering\" but is done by checking to see if a zip code is from the\ntarget state. We can easily accommodate this by using encapsulation without adding complexity and achieving flexibility.\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportLocationFiltering\n{\n bool IsIn(State state);\n}\n\n\nclass FilterRule\n{\n private readonly State TargetState;\n\n public IList Filter(IList itemsToFilter)\n {\n IList filteredItems = new ArrayList();\n foreach(IsupportLocatinFiltering supporter in itemsToFilter)\n	if(items.IsIn(TagetState)) filteredItems.Add(supporter)\n return filteredItems;\n }\n}\n</pre>\n\nNow its up to each implementation of ISupportLocationFiltering to know if it can be filtered by a state. Our Interface is much more useful then just for filtering so we can accommodate future changes by renaming it to something more useable\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportALocation\n{\n bool IsIn(State state);\n}\n</pre>', '2008-10-27 23:40:54')[0m

It will take time to take Ruby/LAMP to the same place (engineering, development, support) as Java/J2EE in IT.<br />- Managing/supporting Mongrel is painful: Passenger mod_rails is an attractive solution as it simplifies deployment of Ruby applications. We\'re moving ahead with it<br /><br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why use MySQL if you have Oracle?</span> Most enterprises run and support Oracle, so incremental Oracle database cost is zero. Why should one use MySQL then? Does it matter? If so, where/what and how much?<br />- MySQL is primary database for most open source software (including Ruby) and hence some software components (plugins etc.) only work on MySQL (at least in early phases)<br />- MySQL enables agile development practices<br />- Enterprise/core/reused datasets vs. \"Application\" datasets<br /><br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How will we choose between Java and Ruby?</span><br />- We plan to continue maintaining our Java apps using existing technology (Java/J2EE)<br />- For new apps, I suggest Ruby as the starting point considering our internal needs...Here\'s why:<br />Java offers high efficiency of execution with byte code compilation (JVM), whereas Ruby offers simplicity, maintainability and productivity gains. Most internal apps can be developed using Ruby unless complex integration with Java systems is needed.<br />(a) Most internal enterprise apps are simple and don’t require high efficiency of execution (e.g. many thousands of users and high-volume, real-time data processing)<br />(b) Performance gains from Ruby to Java aren’t significant from end-user perspective (server-side performance is negligible from end-user perspective)<br /></li></ol><br /><br />This discussion in IT raises some important questions?<br /><ul><li>Should we leverage existing infrastructure (Oracle, Java/J2EE (JRuby)) for deploying Ruby applications?</li><li>Is/should MySQL be at par with Oracle in the enterprise?</li><li>Is/should LAMP be at par with J2EE in the enterprise?</li><li>?<br /></li></ul><br />How are you dealing with this in your IT department?', '2008-10-27 23:40:56')[0m

Most offshore outsourcing firms view software development as a manufacturing problem. I don\'t think this way though. You don\'t think this way. In fact the midwest doesn\'t think this way about software. Cray doesn\'t manufacture it’s compilers, it crafts them. DowJones doesn\'t manufacture it\'s systems, it crafts them. They\'re crafted by craftsmen using tools they have often built themselves. Quality is a focus.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally the cost of living here is reasonable compared to either coast. I travel to New York often and stay in a basic room at the Waldorf Astoria in Midtown. It costs around $350 - $400 a month. For that same price I can get a two room suite at The Saint Paul Hotel. I get twice as much hotel here in Saint Paul compared to New York. The same is true for software development. In fact with raising prices in India year after year, the price difference per hour can be as little as $20 and as high as $50. Though on average it\'s around $25 to $35 and hour. That price difference is even less once you take into account soft costs. For example having only one hour time difference, common language, ability to meet in person cheaply (thank you <a href=\"http://www.suncountry.com\">SunCountry</a>). By far the best benefit is talent though. Developers in the midwest are using the best and latest technologies, have access to a number of mentors, conferences and user groups. Did I also mention developers in the Midwest can produce nearly twice as fast as those in India. If this speed is included, developers in the Midwest are actually cheaper and of course, developers in the Midwest focus on quality.</p>\n\n<p> This is the essence of what I call Farmsourcing. This combination of reasonable developer costs, developers that focus on quality, increased productivity and proximity to fields of corn. So how does it work? After all good talent isn\'t cheap. My solution, use unpolished talent, pay them lower wages, mentor them for 1 to 2 years and then get them a better job somewhere else. This solution has problems though - some similar to those India faces.</p>\n\n<p> First I need to find a good source of unpolished talent. For that we have new CS grads from universities like the <a href=\"http://www.umn.edu\">U</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stthomas.edu\">St. Thomas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.macalester.edu/\">Macalester</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metrostate.edu\">Metro State</a> and so on. Let me qualify what I mean by unpolished talent. I define it as someone who understands the concepts but doesn’t know how to implement them.</p>\n\n<p> Second problem is the lower wages. I pay anywhere from $20 to $40 an hour and most times closer to $25. Why would someone work for these lower wages? Let me ask you this question. Why would someone pay to go to grad school? Most likely because they want the final education that will set them apart. Well that\'s what I’m offering: grad school expect they don’t pay - I pay them. Here’s what I tell prospective employees: come work for me for one to two years, I\'ll pay you a decent but lower wage during that time. But I will also mentor you on everything from version control systems and continuous integration to project management and contracting. At the end of the one to two years you\'ll not only be able to get a job worth twice as much but I\'ll help you find it.</p>\n\n<p> The third problem is how to actually mentor barely functional into quite good? Or put another way, how do you scale your team? I\'m not going to go into the details of this since this process is our secret to success. But I\'ll say it\'s a combination of three things: The mentors, the process tools and <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a>. The latter of which I\'ll talk more about.</p>\n\n<p> Rails really makes this happen. First, I can explain <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org\">Ruby</a> to someone in just a couple days. There isn\'t even a book they have to buy to learn it. Try that with C++. Second, Rails is very opinionated. So long as you do things the Rails Way life is easy. When you don\'t, things get hard. It acts like a warning light for newbies when they’re doing something they shouldn’t. I tell them, if it\'s hard, ask a mentor. Third, Rails is Ikea. It has darn near everything you need already so there is no need to build it. This is good for a couple reasons: it makes apps smaller so statistically there should be less bugs, you can produce faster because you don\'t need to build it, and all the code in Rails acts as a nice reference when you do need to build something yourself. Fourth, Rails has testing built in. You need tests when working with barely functionals. Fifth, there is no compile step in Ruby and thus encourages what if exploration which results in deeper learning.</p>\n\n<p>Because of Ruby on Rails and Farmsourcing I no longer worry about the enterprise and every manager and CIO I talk with about Farmsourcing with Ruby on Rails worries less too. They also quickly find a project to try it out on. How big can Farmsourcing get? I’m not sure but what I do know is outsourcing is a $20 billion business and I’m not quite there yet. So if you have capital to invest so we can faster and keep up with demand or are interested in a job, please contact me.</p>\n <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=RyRfyI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=RyRfyI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=Q9j8ki\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=Q9j8ki\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

They have offices in pretty much every country I can think of. During that time I\'ve been working to get them up to speed with Ruby on Rails. This has included getting their outsourced offshore team up to speed as well. What I want to do is share some conclusions I\'ve made from this experience. I gave a talk about this at <a href=\"http://minnebar.org\">Minnebar</a> but wasn\'t able to discuss everything and hope to do so here. What I want to talk about is:\n<ul>\n <li>Why enterprises are outsourcing</li>\n <li>How outsourcing to an offshore team fails them</li>\n <li>Why farmsourcing is better</li>\n <li>How Ruby on Rails seals the deal</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>I use to make fun of the enterprise. That is until I gained a deeper understanding of them. Truth is, they\'re in a rough spot and it\'s this difficulty that sends them outsourcing to an offshore team. It hasn\'t been my experience enterprises desire to do this. They’re not ignorant of the problems this has. They\'re just often left without a choice. Most enterprises have a large backlog of projects for a large number of users. On top of this, enterprises also have problems finding talent especially when trying to compete with benefits like free food, flexible hours, working from home and the chance to make it rich in options that many startups offer. Most daunting to an enterprise though is an increased frustration of users. Users expect their internal apps to work like external apps. Users want their intranet to work like Facebook and their messaging to work like Twitter. Given these difficulties, enterprises look for an escape. They realize their developers can’t make it happen in time. Not because their developers aren’t capable (though quite a few are indeed incapable) but because they\'re so busy just making what already exists just work. Add to this the need to control the bottom line and impossible becomes a real way of summing up the problem. This is why the escape enterprises often go for is outsourcing to an offshore team.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is outsourcing to an offshore team will allow an enterprise to work some projects on the backlog while keeping costs down. Notice I didn’t mention anything about quality. That\'s because when you pick outsourcing you also pick to control time and scope and leave quality to the outsourced developers. <b>The real failure of outsourcing firms is ignoring the fact that they are responsible for quality.</b> Of course there are other problems with offshoring like:\n<ul>\n<li>Timezone Issues</li>\n<li>Poor Communication</li>\n<li>Most use old technology which often result in delivering old technology</li>\n<li>Desire to do what ever the client asks even if it doesn\'t make sense</li>\n<li>Lack of talent - no mentoring</li>\n</ul>\n\nBut the real problem I argue is quality. Don\'t believe me? Ask these questions of any developer working for an offshore outsourcing firm. (Note if they can answer them, keep them)\n<ul>\n	<li>What is the last programming language/API you learn?</li>\n	<li>What programming blogs do you ready daily?</li>\n	<li>Who do you ask when you have a question on code style? Who does that person ask?</li>\n	<li>What are two or three bad coding practices?</li>\n	<li>Why is testing important?</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>Quality is not important because most offshore outsourcing firms see programming as manufacturing and not as craftsmanship. They believe two teams working off the same requirements will result in the exact same application. This thinking is why offshore outsourcing often fails. Quality is ignored in favor of scope and time resulting. So when enterprises finally get the application it only works so long as you click on the right things in the right order and don’t ever try to add a feature, modify a page or upgrade a component because the application was manufactured and not crafted.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t think this way and everyone at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=minnebar&amp;m=tags\">Minnebar</a> doesn\'t think this way. In fact the midwest as a whole doesn\'t think this way. For us it\'s about crafting software, not manufacturing it. For this reason I suggest enterprises Farmsource which I\'ll talk about in my next post.</p>\n <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=vGXWRH\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=vGXWRH\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=RKxPlh\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=RKxPlh\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

I plan to cover why <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a> and the Midwest might just save the enterprise. I\'ll share my experiences with outsourcing Ruby on Rails to various parts of the world, what the large outsourcing firms are doing, why they don\'t get it and how the Midwest could destroy their business in months. You will not be disappointed with this presentation.</p>\n\n<p>This presentation will be the start of many posts, articles and presentation about what I call Farmsourcing. Stay tuned. I plan to change the game.</p>\n <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=Le7JUH\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=Le7JUH\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=cVGm0h\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=cVGm0h\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

Alternately stated, special sauce is anything that could be replaced with an highly downloaded alternative in less time then it takes to describe how bad the special sauce really is.</p>\n<p>BigMac programmers should be avoided at all times as they will bring a cardiac arrest to your project.

It is therefore suggested BigMac programmers be fired and other programmers alerted to their presence. To alert others it is recommend to provide the BigMac Programmer a <a href=\"http://img.skitch.com/20080425-q9btdbu5sm6kwkigqrfn6dpndu.jpg\">certificate</a> noting their BigMac Programmer status.

Overall RSpec Stories are an incredibly powerful tool and have allowed us to take a huge step towards business analysts writing functional specifications (in the form of plain text stories) then allowing the developers to make them pass. Today I\'d like to share how we setup our stories and some of the decisions we made along the way.<br /><br />The first goal was to run the stories from rake so we created a rake task in <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">lib/tasks/stories.rake</span> to run the stories and fail if any of them fail - this was useful when running this from our cruise server.<br /><pre><br /> task :all do<br /> args = ENV[\'story_prefix\'] || \'\'<br /> stories_passed = system \'ruby\', File.join(RAILS_ROOT, \"stories\", \"run_with_all_steps.rb\"), args<br /> raise(\'story failed\') unless stories_passed<br /> end<br /></pre><br />You can invoke this task as <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">rake stories:all</span> or <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">rake stories:all story_prefix=user_</span> and the second variant allow you to run just one (or a subset) of the stories which turned out to be useful as they take a long time to run. Now we\'ll move onto <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">stories/run_with_all_steps.rb</span> which is what actually runs the stories.<br /><br />First some setup of the environment since we\'re invoked from the command line<br /><pre><br /> file_pattern = ARGV[0] || \"*\"<br /> ENV[\"RAILS_ENV\"] = \"test\"<br /> require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + \"/../config/environment\")<br /> require \'spec/rails/story_adapter\'<br /></pre><br />Then two helper functions that load all stories in a directory or use the story_pattern passed in. This is something I haven\'t seen other people do with the RSpec story framework but seemed natural to me as I didn\'t want to have to maintain a list of stories to run and possibly (or probably) forget to add new ones. Stories also have a concept of steps that go along with stories but I didn\'t want to have to to manually associate steps with stories so decided to load them all. There were some clashes with different step files using the same phrase to define their steps but when that happened we just changed the phrasing of one or the other. The only trick in here is the sort on the step_files which was required because windows and the mac and linux loaded the files in a different order causing inconsistency across machines.<br /><pre><br /> def all_local_stories(story_pattern = \"\")<br /> story_path = \"#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/stories\"<br /> Dir[File.expand_path(\"#{story_path}/**/#{story_pattern}*.story\")]<br /> end<br /><br /> def all_steps_for_local_stories<br /> steps_path = \"#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/steps\"<br /> step_files = Dir[File.expand_path(\"#{steps_path}/*.rb\")].sort<br /> step_files.collect do |file|<br /> require file<br /> file.match(/(\\w+)\\.rb\\Z/).captures[0].underscore.to_sym<br /> end<br /> end<br /></pre><br />Lastly we invoke the rspec story runner. What\'s tricky here is that the story runner doesn\'t run here but registers itself using <a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Kernel.html#M005958\">Kernel.at_exit</a> (which I\'d never seen before)<br /><pre><br /> stories = all_local_stories(file_pattern)<br /> stories.each do |file|<br /> with_steps_for(*all_steps_for_local_stories) do<br /> run file, :type => RailsStory<br /> end<br /> end<br /></pre><br />So up to here we can invoke our stories using rake ... but what are stories and how do they work? Stories are just text files written with the template<br /><pre><br />Story: Manage Users<br />As an Administrator<br />I want to manage the users who have access to my application<br />So that private stuff isn\'t seen by the wrong people<br /><br /> Scenario: Revoke access for a user<br /> Given Alex is a registered user<br /> When I delete the user Alex<br /> Then Alex should not be able to access the sensitive content<br /></pre><br />This is pretty cool ... so how does it work? This is where the steps come in. We define a steps file to match each of the Given/When/Then clauses in our story and define what to do for each one.<br /><pre><br />require File.dirname(__FILE__) + \'/../../../spec/spec_helper\'<br /><br />steps_for(:user_management) do<br /> Given(\'$user_name is a registered user\') do |user_name|<br /> @users ||= []<br /> @users << name =\"\"> user_name})<br /> end<br /><br /> When(\'I delete the user $user_name\') do |user_name|<br /> this_user = @users.detect {|a_user| a_user.name == user_name}<br /> this_user.should_not be_nil<br /> this_user.destroy<br /> end<br /><br /> Then(\'$user_name should not be able to access the site\') do |user_name|<br /> get(\"/login?username=#{user_name}\")<br /> response.response_code.should == 401<br /> end<br />end<br /></pre><br />As the rspec story runner parses the story file it looks for a step that matches invokes its block passing a parameter for each $-starting variable in the clause. The way I\'ve written what\'s above we try to maintain some consistency between the variables referred to in the different clauses. If you refer to the user_name as \'Alex\' in the Given clause we store that user away in the <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">@users</span> array and load it from there later on when we want to refer to the same user in the When clause.<br /><br />We\'ve had pretty good success working with stories in this way and as we move forward are going to continue to experiment with<br /><ul><li>Having our business analysts write most of the story files and the developers write the steps.<br /></li><li>Thinking of ways to keep the steps files DRY</li><li>Working with WATIR or Selenium to create stories that drive the browser<br /></li></ul>', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

Most of the people I work with spend their time thinking about how to work with a bunch of people who are halfway around the world with only a few hours when we\'re all awake at the same time. The way we\'ve approached the problem is to take about 20% of the developers and temporarily move them to the US to work alongside us while trying to use technology to collaborate as best we can with the remaining developers (conference calls, IM, email and occasional visits of the US staff to India). We have managed to overcome some of the distance and I personally know many of the developers by all these channels and have met a large number in person (in the US and India), but problems still remain.<br /><br />I know we\'re not the only company to face these problems (in fact a recent blog by Jay Fields <a href=\"http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/09/is-distributed-development-viable.html\">Is Distributed Development Viable</a> is what got me thinking on this topic this week). I agree with most of Jay\'s post but have been wondering <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">If we solved the distributed development problem ... would the problems I see everyday disappear?</span> I have to say they wouldn\'t and when I ask myself why I\'ve concluded that our problem has less to do with the geographic distribution issues we face (which are certainly formidable!!) and more to do with the basic fact that most of our developers work for a different company than we do. I think <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">outsourcing seems to be as big if not a bigger problem than offshoring</span>. <br /><br />What do I mean by that...In my experience successfully developing software is largely dependent on having a team of good people who know each other, have worked together before and are comfortable using their critical thinking and expressing their opinions. I imagine that we decided the rate differential wasn\'t important and flew the entire India based development team to the US to sit next to us tomorrow. The problem we would still have is that the members of my development team would still work for a different company than I do. My company spends a lot of time helping its employees think about their professional development and how to advance their careers. For our developers at our outsourced partner we do none of that (one of the advantages outsourcing is supposed to grant us the advantage of a bigger pool of resources to use but I believe that we don\'t need \"resources\" we need \"developers\" - sorry to dive into my liberal arts education and deconstructionism a little bit :) With outsourcing we give up on thinking of our developers as individuals and spending time and energy (and money) on their professional development and ensuring that they are challenged and want to continue working with us. The effect is that the average tenure of most of these developers is measured in months instead of years. The problem cuts both ways as the developers have an institutional loyalty to their employer and know they will likely not be working with us for the long term so its very hard for many of them to assume the role of trusted team member who makes decisions for the long term.<br /><br />What\'s the solution... I don\'t know. All I know is that the current situation is very difficult and only focusing on shrinking the geographical distance between the US and India does not seem likely to work.<br /><br />If you made it hear thanks for reading, I needed to get this off my chest. I hope to get back to more technical topics with my next post!', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

Of course the example here is simple and the real system has additional features and complexity that I didn\'t show here. Some of these are<br /><ul><li>The import into a 2-step operation where we first ask the user to click \'Validate\' then return a table showing the data as we parsed it. This allows the user to review and verify it was parsed correctly (i.e. the columns were in the correct order). Only on this second page do we provide an \'import\' button that actually persists the new data.</li><li>The data can not only create new people but also update existing ones. The example above with just first and last name is contrived so this wouldn\'t make sense but imagine an example where there are many other columns like address, phone number, etc. Our model code is a bit more complex in that it first tries to find a person with the same first and last names. If it succeeds it will then update that person and only creates a new one if there is no match.</li><li>Some of the additional columns in the real system refer to other models in our system. To deal with these our model code must find other kinds of model objects and pass those into the <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">Person.new</span>. Ensuring the proper errors are sent back to the user in this case is fairly tricky as they may not always show up as part of the ActiveRecord validations.<br /></li></ul><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Downloading data from our app into Excel</span><br />Moving data in this direction was even easier as we just relied on the fact that Excel will open csv files as long as our Rails app returns an Excel MIME type. We add a line to register the mime type with the csv extension<br /><blockquote># config/initializers/mime_types.rb<br />Mime::Type.register \'application/vnd.ms-excel\', :csv<br /></blockquote>Then we had to do for this was add a respond_to.xsl in the appropriate places of our controller<br /><blockquote>class PeopleController < ApplicationController<br />def index<br /> people = Person.all<br /> respond_to do |format|<br /> format.html # index.html.erb<br /> format.csv do<br /> render :text => @people.collect { |person| person.to_csv}.join(\"\\n\")<br /> end<br /> end<br />end<br /></blockquote>and then add a <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">to_csv</span> to the model<br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>class Person < ActiveRecord::Base<br />def to_csv<br /> \"#{first_name}\\t#{last_name}\"<br />end<br />end</blockquote><br />This only works for very simple Excel data on a single worksheet but when that\'s true it makes your job of working with that data so much simpler!<br /></div></div>', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

Since this class was not designed for testability we often run into code that cannot be tested as is. Most often this involves code that assumes it will always be run inside our J2EE Application Server because it depends on classes provided by the server.<br /><br />I was recently working with someone on this Java class<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\"> class Person {<br /> static {<br /> Logger logger = new ContainerLogger();<br /> }<br /><br /> public String doSomething() {<br /> ...<br /> logger.info(\"I did something\");<br /> ...<br /> }<br />}<br /></blockquote>We couldn\'t create a unit test for the doSomething method because the ContainerLogger class was provided by our application server and couldn\'t be used outside the container. We refactored to come up with this solution.<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\">class MyClass {<br /> public static Logger _logger;<br /> public Logger logger() {<br /> if (_logger == null) {<br /> logger = new ContainerLogger(); <br /> }<br /> return _logger;<br /> }<br /><br /> public String doSomething() {<br /> ...<br /> logger().info(\"I did something\");<br /> ...<br /> }<br />}<br /></blockquote>We refactored our code to access the logger using the accessor method <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">logger()</span> then we also made the logger variable itself public at the same time. Why did we do those two seemingly contradictory things? The accessor method implements the singleton pattern preserving the semantics of the static initializer and the public access to the instance variable <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">_logger</span> allows us to replace the implementation with a mock in our test.<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\">public class TestMyClass extends TestCase {<br /> public void testSomething() {<br /> MyClass._logger = new MockLogger();<br /> assert(MyClass.doSomething(), \"expected return\");<br /> }<br />}</blockquote>I\'ve seen too much legacy Java code that assumes it will always run inside a container but with testing we need to change our mindsets because when running a test we will be outside the container. All dependencies on the container (and in most applications I\'ve seen we don\'t need that many!) should be encapsulated and able to be mocked through dependency injection.

This lesson was learned in the 1990s in the context of a Windows application. What we did was quickly draw part of the screen (or a splash image) immediately then do the time consuming work in the background so that by the time the user was ready to interact with the application we\'d be ready for them.<br /><br />Recently I was reminded of this lesson on a website I\'m working on. We have a complicated report to show on the user\'s homepage. My first implementation involved generating the report in real-time when the page is loaded but this was very slooooow. Some profiling and analysis let us make it somewhat faster but not fast enough.<br /><br />I was stumped until I remembered my old lesson. If it wasn\'t possible to generate the report quickly, perhaps we could do it sometime when the user wouldn\'t mind.<br /><br />Luckily this is a Rails application and ActiveRecord Callbacks make it easy to do this. I could pregenerate the report and update a portion of it each time something is saved. Users expect a save to take some time and don\'t do it that often. Then generating the homepage becomes just a simple matter of displaying the existing rows.<br /><br />First I setup my models to call into the report generator every time they change<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class Person < ActiveRecord::Base<br /> after_destroy {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.destroyed(person)}<br /> after_create {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.created(person) }<br /> after_update {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.updated(person) }<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Then I implement the complicated (and slow) logic to pre-compute the rows in the report in a library class<br /><br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />module ReportGenerator<br /> class Executive<br /> def destroyed(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to delete from the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> def created(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to add to the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> def updated(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to update in the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> end<br /> #Similar classes corresponding to the other models that trigger recalculations would go here<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Finally I can show the report on the homepage with some boring (and fast) Rails code<br /><br />Model:<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class Report < ActiveRecord::Base<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Controller:<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class ReportsController < ApplicationController<br /> @report =\" ReportRows.find_by_user(current_user)\"><br /></span></pre><br /><br />and the View:<br /><br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br /><% for row in @report %><br /> Display the row<br /><% end %><br /></span></pre><br /><br />The interesting insight for me is that when optimizing there are sometimes hard problems that can\'t be solved. Its important not to lose sight of the goal you\'re aiming at (a satisfying user experience) and that sometimes involves spending the computational time somewhere where the user won\'t mind.', '2008-10-27 23:40:59')[0m

One does not visit; one pays homage, or, at the very list, makes a pilgrimage. Its chef, Dan Barber, is <a href=\"http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/06/blue-hill-at-stone-barns-pocantico-hills-new-york-dan-barber-working-farm.html\">justifiably famous</a> for his pioneering role in the evolution of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/food/2006/09/the_haute_barnyard_hall_of_fam.html\">haute barnyard cuisine</a>, and the food at the restaurant is truly delicious. I first visited last December, and, due to a Christmas season traffic jam, my group arrived too late to take our planned jaunt around the farm. So when Lisa and I were looking for something to do last Saturday afternoon, we decided to get in her car and head across the Tappan Zee to the Stone Barns Center in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrytown,_New_York\">Tarrytown</a>.<br /><br />Stone Barns sits on the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_State_Park_Preserve\">Rockefeller estate</a> in the Pocantico Hills section of town. The buildings themselves date from the 1930\'s, and were first part of a dairy farm, and later the location of Peggy Rockefeller\'s cattle ranch. In 2004, the Rockefellers invited Dan Barber to open a for-profit restaurant as part of the larger not-for-profit agricultural and educational experiment - a center for learning about environmentally responsible, four-season farming with a restaurant to match.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SP4rpNKXFBI/AAAAAAAAFb8/zC4lCwmLraU/s1600-h/P1020632.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SP4rpNKXFBI/AAAAAAAAFb8/zC4lCwmLraU/s400/P1020632.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259689401723065362\" border=\"0\" /></a>It\'s easy to see why the experiment took root so quickly and so deeply. The property itself is stunning - all gentle slopes and rolling hills, with the stately barns rising out of a hollow in the valley. Walking around the pastures and the vegetable fields, you run into all sorts - parents pushing strollers, locals out for a morning jog, and foodies paying homage. In addition to the restaurant, there\'s a casual cafe open daily that serves strong, hot coffee (a must for keeping warm on long, blustery walks around the farm), sandwiches, salads and pastries. Almost all of the food on offer is grown or raised on the property, which means the menus are exclusively seasonal and change daily.<br /><br />Lisa and I arrived around 1 o\'clock, and started our visit with a quick trip to the gift shop. I know, I know - but, this is a truly excellent shop. I picked up a couple of $6 grocery tote bags - perfect stocking stuffers - and a fantastic (and challenging) trivia game called <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Foodie-Fight-Trivia-Game/Joyce-Lock/e/9780811858649/?itm=1\">Foodie Fight</a>. I also spied a truly gorgeous cookbook called <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Country-Cooking-of-France/Anne-Willan/e/9780811846462/?itm=1\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Country Cooking of France</span></a>, which is going on my Christmas list.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0HIFaEDI/AAAAAAAAFc8/4nlFtJ9j0gQ/s1600-h/P1020602.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0HIFaEDI/AAAAAAAAFc8/4nlFtJ9j0gQ/s400/P1020602.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528299197829170\" border=\"0\" /></a>Since it was lunchtime, and since we needed fortification for our planned walk, we decided to have lunch next. The line snakes around the tiny cafe in a circle, which gave us ample opportunity to scope out all that was on offer. I grabbed a jar of cucumber pickles from the shelf, and thought seriously about the cow-printed tea towels and teeny coffee cakes. Also available: the decidedly not local but truly delicious <a href=\"http://www.ranchogordo.com/\">Rancho Gordo</a> heirloom beans.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQSu0KaG16I/AAAAAAAAFcs/LCDCeEDho14/s1600-h/collage.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 250px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQSu0KaG16I/AAAAAAAAFcs/LCDCeEDho14/s400/collage.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261522475845867426\" border=\"0\" /></a>We finally made it up to the counter, where we ordered the bologna sandwich with pickles, zucchini fritatta, caramel apple, apple custard tart, and two big, steaming cups of coffee. We camped out at a picnic table outside and wolfed down our feast.<br /><br />The homemade bologna was the best bologna I have ever tasted - light in texture, tangy and meaty in flavor, and layered on a fluffy piece of focaccia spread with strong mustard. The apple tart was a bit too sweet, but the cookie crumble crust on the bottom was salty enough to cut the sugar. The caramel apple, served on a twig, was deliciously smoky, if tooth-crackingly tough to bite into. All in all, a good lunch.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0MQtv_2I/AAAAAAAAFdE/3Fd4aV47APU/s1600-h/P1020609.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0MQtv_2I/AAAAAAAAFdE/3Fd4aV47APU/s400/P1020609.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528387413868386\" border=\"0\" /></a>Finally, filled with lunchtime goodness, we set off on a walk around the property. We walked past the private dining room, where the staff were setting up for a wedding, arranging flowers and building a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuppah\">chuppah</a> out of twigs and berries from the farm and surrounding park. We saw a fallow vegetable field, walked past the dairy cows relaxing in their pasture, and paid a visit to the chickens, who gathered around our feet, pecking gently at our toes in search of a snack.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0Cu7scQI/AAAAAAAAFc0/5qQvUqYqApA/s1600-h/P1020641.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0Cu7scQI/AAAAAAAAFc0/5qQvUqYqApA/s400/P1020641.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528223726727426\" border=\"0\" /></a>Just past the chickens were a flock of pure-white ducks and a few gigantic pigs. These guys had to be at least three hundred pounds each. As we approached, I remembered the bologna sandwich and started feeling a bit, well, guilty. But then I realized how happy the pigs were, rooting around in their trough, enjoying the sunshine, wandering at will, and realized it was not only the best-tasting bologna I\'d ever eaten - it was also probably the most ethically sound.<br /><br />All in all, that was the prevailing lesson of the day. Seeing where your food comes from, spending time with it, smelling the earth out of which it grew, picking your way across the field where it was raised - it makes you that much more appreciative of it, and far more aware of the impact your choices have. The peace of mind you gain by understanding how your food was produced cannot be overstated. Yes, it can be expensive and a bit of a hassle to eat locally and humanely, but if you can afford the little bit of extra money and a little bit more extra time, it truly is worth it.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0TG6kEaI/AAAAAAAAFdM/5I4saT6Rm5U/s1600-h/P1020649.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0TG6kEaI/AAAAAAAAFdM/5I4saT6Rm5U/s400/P1020649.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528505042342306\" border=\"0\" /></a>', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

But, no - when nothing else appeals, when nothing else will do, cucumbers are where it\'s at for me.<br /><br />And lest you think that I\'m some sort of johnny-come-lately where cucumbers are concerned, let me tell you a little story. When I was in elementary school, my parents had to visit the school each year for the obligatory Parents\' Night. One year (maybe my mom will chime in on the comments and tell us which), the teacher had each of the parents guess which desk belonged to their child my reading the children\'s answers to a set of questions. One of the questions was, \"What\'s your favorite food?\" The other kids mainly answered \"pizza,\" or \"spaghetti\" or \"steak\" - but my answer was \"cucumbers.\"<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SPvZyBHNJ4I/AAAAAAAAFbU/-O50V1rSxnU/s1600-h/IMG_0417.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SPvZyBHNJ4I/AAAAAAAAFbU/-O50V1rSxnU/s400/IMG_0417.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259036443200530306\" border=\"0\" /></a>To this day, I go through about two pounds of cucumbers each week - I slice them into sticks and snack on them on weekend afternoons, I chop them into salads almost every night with dinner, and sometimes I even cook with them. They\'re great in stir-fries, where they add a bit of freshness and crunch; seeded and finely chopped, they add texture and contrast to chicken and tuna salad; and, thinly sliced and lightly sauteed in a bit of butter, salt and pepper, they become a luscious side dish all their own.<br /><br />I love cucumbers in all their incarnations - Kirby, Persian, English, standard - no matter which, the savory melon-like flavor keeps me coming back again and again. I suspect I\'ll never tire of cucumbers - I\'ll probably still be picking them out of salad bowls right up until the end of time.', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

It\'s all very Beckettian, but I digress. The important part: I worked from home, which normally means ordering lunch in to save time and avoid being away from the laptop for too long. However, given the financial situation these days, I\'ve been shamed into being a bit more frugal. So, ordering in is out, cooking in is, well, in.<br /><br />I decided to roast a chicken leg alongside the season\'s first batch of brussels sprouts (Yay!). Given this was a celebratory occasion - brussels sprouts being quite possibly my favorite winter vegetable - bacon seemed in order, too. And, since it would be about five minutes\' prep work, it fit into my agenda - being continuously available when not in the office so as not to look like a slacker.<br /><br />Cleaning and trimming the sprouts is pretty quick work. My method is to trim the root off the bottom, which brings most of the outer leaves with it, leaving very little for you to actually peel back. The fresh sprouts smell a bit like raw broccoli - crisply peppery and generally green. I would be lying if I said I don\'t occasionally nibble on the root trimmings, which squeak and snap between your teeth.<br /><br />Once roasted or sauteed, though, the sprouts are tender and nutty, and slightly stinky - just like broccoli. (And, just like broccoli, they\'re terrible when overcooked or boiled beyond recognition - please don\'t commit this crime against food-manity.) If you like your sprouts well-done, the charred bits are nice and chewy. They go well with anything, in my opinion, but shine brightest when paired with a bit of animal fat, either bacon or schmaltz, and dressed with some balsamic vinegar and a bit of parmesan cheese.<br /><br />I nestled the chicken leg in the pile of prepped sprouts, sprinkled the lot with olive oil, salt and pepper, and tucked the pan into the oven to roast for about half an hour while I went back to being a responsible employee. My reward: the best lunch I\'d had all week, consumed in my pajamas.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic Vinegar and Bacon<br /><br /></span>1 1/2 tbs. olive oil, divided<br />2 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2 inch lardons<br />1/2 pound brussels sprouts, cleaned, trimmed and sliced in half lengthwise<br />1 tbs. good balsamic vinegar<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />In a medium skillet, heat 1/2 tbs. of the olive oil over high heat until hot. Reduce heat to medium and add the bacon to the skillet. Saute until the fat rendered and the bacon is slightly crisped. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve. Pour all but 1 tsp. of the bacon fat from the pan.<br /><br />Add the sprouts to the pan and toss in the remaining bacon fat and the remaining tablespoon of oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and place the skillet in the oven. Roast sprouts to desired level of done-ness, about 25 to 30 minutes for me. Remove skillet from the oven and toss the sprouts with the reserved bacon and the balsamic vinegar. Adjust seasonings and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves 2.</span>', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

Corn, Pollan revealed, is the backbone of our industrial food complex, and is the primary ingredient in many, many more foods than you had ever imagined. It represents the most evil elements of our mechanization of the food chain, and it\'s just bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Of course, Pollan does not think we should stop eating corn in its purer forms - right off the cob, for instance. He\'s far more reasonable than that. But for months after I read the book, I was terrified of buying and eating corn, panicking that I was feeding into a system I had no interest in supporting. Then I realized that I still eat Cheetos (king of hyper-processed corn and erstaz cheese) when I\'m hungover, and decided it was time to buy and eat some sweet corn, particularly since it happens to be in season.<br /><br />When I approached the Migliorelli stand at the Union Square Greenmarket, I noticed they\'d posted a sign: \"No husking.\" Really? I was always taught to husk an ear of corn, just barely, to double-check that the cob was, in fact, intact and free of blemishes. First, you check that it\'s heavy for its size (indicating juiciness), then you pull back the husk just a tad. Rule-follower though I typically I am, I rebelled and husked my ears, rejecting only one out of six (it had no kernels on the top inch of the cob - not a good sign).<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SM6zYumZgJI/AAAAAAAAD8A/T8mAhhl1llQ/s1600-h/IMG_0443.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SM6zYumZgJI/AAAAAAAAD8A/T8mAhhl1llQ/s400/IMG_0443.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246327853340524690\" border=\"0\" /></a>I brought the corn home and, once all the groceries were put away, the time came to cook it. One problem: I had never shucked corn inside. Ever. Growing up in Connecticut, land of patios and porches, corn shucking was an outdoor ritual. It seems wrong to shuck corn anywhere but the the back steps, holding the cob over a paper grocery bag big enough to catch all the silk. I stood at my tiny counter for a minute, seriously contemplated climbing out onto the fire escape, and then decided to just give indoor shucking a shot. Let\'s just say there was a fair bit of clean up involved, despite my best efforts to aim for the bag.<br /><br />Next, I brought a pot of (unsalted - salt makes the corn tough) water to boil and added the freshly shucked cobs to it, removing them a few moments later when they had begun to smell of - you guessed it - corn. Unscientific, I know, but it works. I cooked five ears - clearly too many to eat in one sitting. I set four ears aside to cool and use later in the week.<br /><br />The fifth I rubbed with butter, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and ate, standing up, in my kitchen. The butter ran down my chin, the corn got stuck in my teeth (This, I remembered, was why my grandfather always cut his off the cob.), and I generally made a mess of myself.<br /><br />It was lovely.', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

Maybe it\'s that they\'re a root, or maybe it\'s that they (sometimes) come in that Christmas-y red color (and also in candy cane-esque red and white stripes). Either way, I was pleasantly surprised a couple of years ago when I realized that they are, in fact, part of summer\'s ridiculous bounty (and are in season all the way through October).<br /><br />Pleased because they go so well with another of summer\'s denizens, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_beans\">green beans</a>. For some reason, the sharp, slightly peppery flavor of the beans plays gorgeously against the sweet, earthy beets, resulting in some of the best salads of the season - particularly when you throw some sherry vinegar, greek yogurt and fresh dill into the mix.<br /><br />Last weekend, looking for a way to use up the second half of the Knoll Crest pasta I bought, I decided to turn one of my favorite summer salads into a pretty summer pasta - egg fettucine with roasted beets, green beans, dill and yogurt.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SLGLou14c5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/oubgh2YrXTE/s1600-h/IMG_0476.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SLGLou14c5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/oubgh2YrXTE/s400/IMG_0476.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238121373493654418\" border=\"0\" /></a>I started off by roasting the beets, which is a pretty simple task. You wash them, trim the ends off, drizzle them with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast them in a foil packet for about 45 minutes. Once they\'re cool, peeling them is a cinch - just start yourself off with a small paring knife, and rub the skins off with your fingers. Yes, you\'ll get beet juice all over your hands, but, don\'t worry - it washes off.<br /><br />You can marinate the beets overnight in a little oil and lemon juice, or you can use them right away. Either way, they\'re delicious. The beans just need a quick <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching\">blanching</a> in salted water - this will par-cook them and also make sure they are at their brightest green color.<br /><br />And, if you\'re going low-carb these days, just leave the pasta out - this makes an excellent warm salad, too.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fettucine with Beets and Beans</span><br /><br />1/2 lb. assorted fresh beets<br />1/2 lb. fresh green beans<br />Olive oil<br />1/2 red onion, finely minced<br />1 tbs. sherry vinegar<br />1/4 cup chopped dill<br />1/2 lb. fresh fettucine<br />1/3 cup plain yogurt<br />Salt and pepper, to taste<br /><br />Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Clean and trim the beets. Spread a piece of foil on a cookie sheet, place beets on the foil, and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Fold the foil to form a packet, and place the packet (on the cookie sheet) in the oven. Roast for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the beets are tender when poked with a fork. Remove pack from oven and set aside to cool.<br /><br />Once beets are cool, peel them and cut into 1-inch cubes. Set aside. Meanwhile, trim the beans and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching\">blanch them</a> in a pot of boiling, salted water. Cut each bean in half (on an angle, if you\'re feeling fancy) and set aside.<br /><br />Bring the water to boil again (yes, you can use the same water, just add a little extra salt), and cook the pasta while you make the sauce.<br /><br />Add about 1 tbs. of olive oil to a medium skillet set over medium heat, and cook the onion until fragrant and softened, about two minutes. Add the sherry vinegar and cook down until it has become a bit thick and syrupy. Add the beans and beets to the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until warmed through and coated with the vinegar and onion. Add all but a couple pinches of the dill and cook for another minute or so.<br /><br />Add the cooked pasta to the pan, toss everything together, and transfer to bowls to serve. Top the pasta with the yogurt, dividing between the two bowls. Do the same with remaining dill, adjust seasonings to taste, and dig in!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves two.</span>', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

A classic example is the group of women who run the Knoll Crest poultry stand, by far the market\'s most popular destination for eggs and chicken. They know most of their customers by looks, and some by name. They know that I always want a chicken, that 3 pounds is my ideal chicken size, and that I buy a dozen large brown eggs every other week or so.<br /><br />They also know that, every now and again, I\'ll give in to temptation and pick up a container of their remarkably fresh egg fettuccine.<br /><br />I did just that this past Saturday, reasoning that the tomatoes I\'d bought a few stands over deserved a gorgeous bed upon which to recline. Or some such thing. Basically, I really wanted pasta with a quick tomato sauce for lunch.<br /><br />When I got home, I washed my tomatoes, picked some <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2008/08/getting-my-hands-dirty.html\">basil from my windowsill plant</a>, and sliced a couple of cloves of garlic. A little olive oil went into the skillet, then the garlic and red pepper flakes, then the tomatoes and basil.<br /><br />While that cooked for a minute or two (just to warm the tomatoes through and get the basil working), I quickly cooked the pasta in boiling, salted water - since it was fresh, it took about 90 seconds to cook completely through to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente\">al dente</a>. I added the fettuccine to the skillet, whooshed everything around for a few minutes, tasted for seasoning (tomatoes like a good amount of salt, in my opinion), and spooned it out.<br /><br />The pasta was great - toothsome and flavorful, and the sauce was just what I wanted - simple and honest, just tomatoes, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper. My lunches are rarely so satisfying - so, thank you, Knoll Crest Farm, for being so darn friendly, and for making such fricking awesome pasta.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saturday Lunch Pasta<br /></span><br />2 tsps. olive oil<br />2 cloves garlic, sliced (thinly) crosswise<br />1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes<br />1/2 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise<br />4-5 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced crosswise<br />1/4 lb. fresh egg pasta, such as fettuccine or linguine<br />Salt, to taste<br /><br />Add the olive oil to a medium skillet set over medium heat, and, once it is warm, add the garlic to the pan. Sauté until fragrant and softened, about one minute, then add the red pepper flakes, tomatoes, and a pinch of salt. Sauté for a minute or two, stirring constantly, then add 2/3 of the sliced basil, stirring to distribute throughout the sauce.<br /><br />Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente (about 1-2 minutes for fresh pasta). Drain and add the pasta to the skillet, stirring to distribute the sauce evenly throughout the pasta. Allow to cook in the skillet for a minute, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking - this will flavor the pasta more deeply - then transfer to a bowl.<br /><br />Adjust seasonings, top with remaining basil, and eat!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves one; multiplies easily to serve many.</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span></span>', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

But, in my humble opinion, chicken is never so good as when it is trussed, rubbed all over with some sort of fat (olive oil, butter, and schmaltz are best), showered with salt and pepper, and roasted in a hot, dry oven. I believe this to be, at the risk of hubris, the absolute best way of cooking chicken. Ever.<br /><br />If you\'re feeling fancy, you can make a pan sauce out of the drippings. Also good - using some of those drippings in the vinaigrette for the salad or vegetables you serve alongside. And please save the carcass and use it for stock - it will be the best and cheapest stock you\'ve ever made, and it will mean using every last bit of that wonderful chicken that gave its life for your supper.

Some say its roots lie in the deadened taste buds of modern America, some say it\'s just the result of excellent advertising on the part of TBWA (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolut_Vodka\">on behalf of Absolut</a>, of course). According to those theories, Americans are either without taste or just plain malleable.<br /><br />Either way, I blame the vodka craze for the fact that I didn\'t even taste <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin\">gin</a> until my mid-20\'s. My mother never had it in the house, and I grew up viewing it as the drink of degenerate, 19th century Englishmen and -women.<br /><br />For shame, truly, because gin is AWESOME. There is no better word to describe the fantastic concoction of alcohol and herbs that is a quality gin. Right now, I\'m enjoying a gin martini (which, by definition, requires vermouth, and if you don\'t think so, you\'re wrong) - 3 ounces of <a href=\"http://plymouthgin.com/\">Plymouth</a>, a tablespoon on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noilly_Prat\">Noilly dry</a>, stirred vigorously with ice, and garnished with some lemon zest (I don\'t really like olives.). And it\'s fabulous - complex, herby, smooth, delicious.<br /><br />So please, please - next time you\'re out, stop yourself from ordering that vodka soda and go for a gin and tonic instead (assuming the place has decent gin - most places at least have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanqueray\">Tanqueray</a>, which makes a good G&amp;T).

In the last couple of years, though, I\'ve finally realized how nice it is to have fresh herbs around when you need them, and, even more than that, how much life and verve plants bring into a home.<br /><br />My friend Nick gave me a Meyer lemon tree for Christmas, and <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2008/04/update-not-dead-yet.html\">my success at keeping it alive</a> for more than six months gave me the confidence to go out and find some more green things for the windowsill. So, yesterday morning, armed with $15 and a dream, I went down to the Union Square Greenmarket and bought two basil plants, a thyme plant, and a little sage bush.<br /><br />I brought them home (carefully, on the subway) and transplanted them into the <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70075921\">Ikea pots</a> I had waiting. The whole process took about 20 minutes (though I did make a bit of a mess), and now I have a gorgeous-smelling assortment of plants.

(Not all the time, though - a girl needs to leave room for her Diet Coke and her booze.)<br /><br />My coffeemaker of choice is a <a href=\"http://www.bodumusa.com/shop/line.asp?MD=1&amp;GID=3&amp;LID=10&amp;CHK=&amp;SLT=&amp;mscssid=E1QDST3SWC738NSAGC467PWFBUJL25GA\">Bodum Chambord French press</a> - I love it for the counter space it saves and also for the rich, hearty brew it produces. But one thing it doesn\'t do is make espresso.<br /><br />To date, I haven\'t invested in an espresso maker - it seems like an awful lot of money for something that would probably be used two times a week, maximum. Plus, it would take up precious counter space in my tiny kitchen. But, if I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">could </span>buy any espresso maker on earth, I think it would have to be this powder-blue FrancisFrancis! model. It\'s gorgeous, it\'s hard-working, and it\'s long-lasting. What more could a girl want?<br /><br />But, alas, at almost $900, it\'s way out of reach.

Sure, we city-dwellers enjoy our fair portion of shared brunches, and more than our allotment of shared dinners, but we rarely see our friends spreading jam on toast while still wearing their footsie pajamas.<br /><br />Maybe it\'s because I live alone, but, to me, eating breakfast with friends is a real treat, a true novelty, and something I really look forward to when traveling. And it doesn\'t have to be a fancy pancake breakfast, either (though those are fun, too) - sometimes the best breakfast is just coffee and a brioche smeared with butter and jam.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI87GPHVVfI/AAAAAAAAD2s/8mak--Rm-iw/s1600-h/IMG_0372.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI87GPHVVfI/AAAAAAAAD2s/8mak--Rm-iw/s400/IMG_0372.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228462670722979314\" border=\"0\" /></a>Louisa and I made <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2007/09/let-us-eat-brioche.html\">our first loaves of brioche together last summer</a>, and during my visit this year we decided we couldn\'t let the opportunity to create a true tradition pass us by. This time, though, we decided to make one full loaf and six small, traditional brioches, the better to snack and breakfast on.<br /><br />The little guys were just as easy to make as the big one - we followed the same recipe as last time and used half the dough to fill Louisa\'s silicon brioche pan (with a cookie sheet underneath to lend stability to the flexible material) and half for the loaf. You could also use the <a href=\"http://www.surlatable.com/product/tinned+steel+brioche+molds.do?search=basic&amp;keyword=brioche&amp;sortby=gsa&amp;asc=true&amp;page=1\">more traditional brioche molds</a> - again, just stick them on a cookie sheet to make the whole thing easier. We topped the individual brioches with the same egg wash used on the loaf, and added some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovado\">muscovado sugar</a> for added crunch (and to make things all pretty-like).<br /><br />The result? A loaf for French bread and sandwich-making, and six perfect breakfast treats, perfect for enjoying with friends and a big pot of coffee.', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

Which of course means that I\'m desperate to entertain as many friends as possible, the better to experiment with copious amounts of produce and seafood.<br /><br />The only problem? It\'s really freakin\' hot out, and that makes having people over a bit more complicated. Sure, I have a great AC stuck through one of my two windows, but it doesn\'t do a whole lot when the oven and stove are going full blast and there are five extra people in here.<br /><br />So, what\'s a girl to do? Moving is not an option, nor is the complete absence of cooking. Not for me, anyway. So I spend my summers searching high and low for meals that can be made in advance, served mostly at room temperature, and showcase all the delicious things in season right now. Because, really, most of this stuff is better left as pristine as possible. I mean, there\'s nothing better than popping a single, tart blueberry in your mouth, or stealing a ripe, earthy tomato from the bowl and eating it plain.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, this meant starting with a <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/SUMMER-CORN-SOUP-242979\">gorgeous corn soup</a> courtesy of Dorie Greenspan, and following that up with a <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/grilled-tuna-nicoise-platter-recipe/index.html\">giant salad niçoise</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/MASCARPONE-FILLED-CAKE-WITH-SHERRIED-BERRIES-242873\">buttermilk cake with mascarpone and berries</a>. As far as no-cook meals go, this was on the more-cooking-than-not end of the scale. The soup was made ahead but had to be re-heated, the salad took lots of prep work, even though it was all super-easy, the tuna had to be seared just before eating, and the cake couldn\'t be assembled ahead of time.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI0wVH5mBhI/AAAAAAAADyI/JklETbNu1Fw/s1600-h/IMG_0418.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI0wVH5mBhI/AAAAAAAADyI/JklETbNu1Fw/s400/IMG_0418.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5227887881903015442\" border=\"0\" /></a>Last night, though, I served what I think might just be the perfect summertime dinner party meal. We started things off with <a href=\"http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2003/aquavit/gravlax.html\">homemade gravlax</a> - which meant, literally, zero cooking. You just cure the raw salmon in a salt/sugar/pepper/dill mixture, then serve it with a coffee and mustard flavored sauce.<br /><br />Next up, <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/gazpacho-recipe/index.html\">Ina Garten\'s superlative gazpacho</a>. A lot of chopping, but, again, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">no</span> cooking. (And, as gazpacho goes, remarkably deep in flavor and perfectly imperfect in texture.)

My cravings tend to run in the salty/greasy direction (bad Chinese, fried chicken, <a href=\"http://www.robscape.com/files/prod-pirate-booty.php\">Pirate\'s Booty</a>), but, every so often, a need for cake worms its way in.<br /><br />Last Sunday, just such a craving hit me like a sack of bricks, and I decided to assuage said sack with a marble cupcake from <a href=\"http://www.twolittleredhens.com/\">Two Little Red Hens</a>. Conveniently located about half a block from my Yorkville apartment, it\'s an adorable bakery specializing in traditional American treats. They have ridiculously good <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?s=5b1a22bd1dc825e5893f0bd2beb02554&amp;showtopic=83368&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1134823\">maple scones</a>, beautiful cakes, and witty frosted cookies (featured on Sunday: hot dogs and watermelon slices). They also make a mean iced coffee.<br /><br />The marble cupcake was good - especially the cake part, which was white sponge swirled with chocolate. The buttercream was tasty, but a bit too cold from the fridge. It just didn\'t give enough, and as a result broke off in little pieces. It was a bit like eating (really, really) buttery fudge. That said, it did hit the spot.<br /><br />So, is it bad that this was my dinner on Sunday night?', '2008-10-27 23:41:01')[0m

Better than all the jazzy so-called locks that some companies try and push onto unsuspecting customers.</p>\n\n\n	<p>Locking your bike does not guarantee 100% security, its just to make it harder to foil a theft.</p>\n\n\n	<p>Some simple thumb rules can preventing some heart ache</p>\n\n\n	<ul>\n	<li>Always <span class=\'caps\'>ALWAYS</span> lock your bike. Be Paranoid.</li>\n		<li>Always make sure the frame and the wheels are locked like shown below.</li>\n		<li>Always lock the bike to something stationary. Check the stationary object, it might not be as strong as you think.</li>\n		<li>Remove movable parts – cyclo-computers, expensive saddle bags and lights can easily be slipped off and carried with you.</li>\n		<li>Its amazing how many folks have lost their bikes at home. Always lock your bike, even at home</li>\n		<li>Don’t keep the bike locked in dark dingy places. Makes it much easier for thieves to work on the lock and steal the bike. Lock the bike in a fairly visible place.</li>\n		<li>Try and change the place you lock the bike everyday.</li>\n		<li>Keep your Name and contact info on the bike – inside the seat post for example. If you lose your bike, it becomes much easier to prove that its yours.</li>\n	</ul>\n\n\n	<p>Bike theft is still not a huge problem in India like some of the Western countries for example. Kryptonite, which manufactures some fantastic locks, has named quite a few of <a href=\'http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Products/List.aspx?cid=1000&amp;#38;scid=1002\'>its Chain locks</a> after New York, a city which is paranoid about locking its bikes.</p>\n\n\n	<p><a href=\'http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohan_kini/sets/72157606883533837/\'><img src=\'http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2786402738_cae543dfb9_o.png\' alt=\'\' /></a></p>\n\n\n	<p>[Update] Gautam had made a very sensible comment on this post asking for more India specific info. Where do folks lock their bikes in India ?</p>\n\n\n	<p>At the moment we dont have many bicycle parking in the country so it basically boils down to finding a strong stationary object like a lamp post or railing and securing your bicycle using a lock. At work I lock up my bike to a huge generator. <br> \nAs long as you are not causing anyone any inconvenience it should be ok to secure your bike to some public property/item.</p>\n\n\n	<p>We do have groups in the country who are lobbying for bike amenities to get stuff like this to make life easier. \n<br>Interested ? join us.</p>\n\n\n&lt;noscript> <a href=\'http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/872527/\'>How good is the post “Bike Security 101”</a> <br /> <span> (<a href=\'http://www.polldaddy.com\'> polls</a>)</span>&lt;/noscript>\n ', '2008-10-27 23:41:02')[0m

(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_2005\">source</a>)<br />But in terms of the GDP per capita, India(122nd place) is way behind Singapore(22nd place) (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">source</a>)<br />Tourism is one of the largest industries of Singapore, with about 9 million tourists in 2005.<br /><br />Singapore has a rich mixture of different cultures as it is mainly formed out of immigrants from Malay, Chinese, Indian, British among other places. From what I observed, the identity of singapore as a country has evolved as an amalgam of the different immigrants who have settled there.<br /><br />The importance given to small details which may seem insignificant to us Indians, hit me right on the face. Be it the roads, or the cleanliness, or the infrastructure effort that has gone into the architecture and planning, especially with respect to the tourists, it is commendable.<br />The blend of art and technology is visible everywhere. Its indeed very difficult to get lost out there, with all the indicators and helpful people. The creativity with which the places are built makes it a pleasure for tourists to spend time.<br /><br />Well, they do have their own set of problems, which I wont go into now, but on the whole, it is a beautiful country.My visit made me learn a lot about India too, along with, needless to say, Singapore.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3097/1236/1600/SUC50003.0.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3097/1236/400/SUC50003.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />I am not trying to compare two nations and rate them or anything of that sort. The few days that I have seen in singapore is very trivial to make any such comparison. And also, as obvious from the facts, the scale at which these countries operate is totally different.<br /><br />It was definitely a good decision to visit Singapore. Thanks to my sister who pushed for it the most, we decided to go in the last moment. I\'ll upload a few snaps when I get some time.<br /><br />Majulah Singapura!!

Some were of the opinion that it was horrible and i should get it cut as soon as possible, but there was a minority of them who showed quite positive reactions to it :-). Some asked me if I had taken a vow or an oath that till I do something I wouldn\'t get it cut and some others teased me saying that my girlfriend had probably ditched me and i had lost interest in life. I was being compared to all sorts of people ranging from musicians to saints to film actors to mythological characters and what not! There were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">very very</span> few people who were totally indifferent to this and went on as normal.<br /><br />Nevertheless, i continued growing my hair till I felt like doing it. Honestly, there was no other reason at all. And there need not be.<br /><br />After about 6 months, one fine day I just went and got my haircut done and was back to my normal looks.<br />Now again all the reactions(fun ;-)) started. People who had liked my long hair started scolding me as to why I did this and lost my individuality! And others phewed sighs of relief and said that they could atleast see me now.<br />Again mixed reactions!<br />Anyway, my experiment ended here and I am \"back to normal?\"!

What is universally agreed is that any \"random number generator\" based solely on deterministic computation cannot be regarded as a \"true\" random number generator, since its output is inherently predictable. John von Neumann once famously said \"Anyone who uses arithmetic methods to produce random numbers is in a state of sin\", thus neatly summarizing the situation.<br />- Wikipedia (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator\">Random number Generator</a>)<br /><br />For eg., if you use a single random number generation algorithm and initialize it with the same seed twice, it generates the same sequence of random(??) numbers.<br />Yes, there are <a href=\"http://lavarnd.com/\">random number generators</a> which use chaotic sources to generate \"high quality\" random numbers. But in the end, all they seem to use is the inherent randomness in the universe to generate random numbers.<br /><br />This is in fact pointing to something quite fundamental.<br />Is there anything thats actually random in this universe?<br />Look at this now:<br />What exactly is chaos? The name \"chaos theory\" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data (see <a href=\"http://www.imho.com/grae/chaos/chaos.html\">here</a>).<br /><br />To look at an example,<br />The flapping of a single butterfly\'s wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month\'s time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn\'t happen.

There are lots of Web automation and testing tools out there and I\'m not trying to compare. But the choice of a tool should not come in the way of development or maintaining the application. It should have minimum interference with the application but still achieve the purpose. And you should be able to extend the tool to your needs. And I think Sahi goes a long way in achieving all this. It just works like a charm.

They keep happening every now and then, for books/movies and every kind of media. What is the root cause of such fanaticism in people?<br /><br /><blockquote>\"...So in every religion you find there are the three stages: philosophy,mythology, and ceremonial. There is one advantage which can be pleaded for the Vedanta, that in India, fortunately, these three stages have been sharply defined. In other religions the principles are so interwoven with the mythology that it is very hard to distinguish one from the other. The mythology stands supreme, swallowing up the principles; and in course of centuries the principles are lost sight of. The explanation, the illustration of the principle, swallows up the principle, and the people see only the explanation, the prophet, the preacher, while the principles have gone out of existence almost - so much so that even today, if a man dares to preach the principles of Christianity apart from Christ, they will try to attack him and think he is wrong and dealing blows at Christianity. In the same way, if a man wants to preach the principles of Mohammedanism, Mohammedans will think the same; because concrete ideas, the lives of great men and prophets, have entirely overshadowed the principles.<br /><br />In Vedanta the chief advantage is that it was not the work of one single man; and therefore, naturally, unlike Buddhism, or Christianity, or Mohammedanism, the prophet or teacher did not entirely swallow up or overshadow the principles. The principles live, and the prophets, as it were, form a secondary group, unknown to Vedanta. The Upanishads speak of no particular prophet, but they speak of various prophets and prophetesses. The old Hebrews had something of that idea; yet we find Moses occupying most of the space of the Hebrew literature. Of course I do not mean that it is bad that these prophets should take religious hold of a nation; but it certainly is very injurious if the whole field of principles is lost sight of. We can very much agree as to principles, but not very much as to persons. The persons appeal to our emotions; and the principles, to something higher, to our calm judgement. Principles must conquer in the long run, for that is the manhood of man. Emotions many times drag us down to the level of animals. Emotions have more connection with the senses than with the faculty of reason; and, therefore, when principles are entirely lost sight of and emotions prevail, religions degenerate into fanaticism and sectarianism. They are no better than party politics and such things. The most horribly ignorant notions will be taken up, and for these ideas thousands will be ready to cut the throats of their brethren. This is the reason that, though these great personalities and prophets are tremendous motive powers for good, at the same time their lives are altogether dangerous when they lead to the disregard of the principles they represent. That has always led to fanaticism, and has deluged the world in blood....\"</blockquote><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Quoted from:</span> <a href=\"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/complete_works.htm\">Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda</a> Volume 6 (<a href=\"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_6/lectures_and_discourses/the_methods_and_purpose_of_religion.htm\">The Methods and Purpose of Religion</a>)<br /></div>', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

After struggling a lot with the configurations and searching on the web I shot a mail to one of the people behind CC and quite soon, I had the answer.<br /><br />There was a simple mistake that was causing Cruise to behave randomly. The problem was that the system time on the Repository server and the time on the cruise control box was not synchronized. There was some 5-6 hour difference between the two. CruiseControl checks for modifications that have happened after a given time. So if the time is not synchronized, obviously it wouldn\'t find modifications!<br /><br />This is very important whenever CruiseControl and the Source repository are on different machines:<br />Make sure that the time/date on the cruise box is synchronized with the time/date on the repository box.<br />Btw, <a href=\"http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/Frequently+Asked+Questions\">This</a> may be helpful.', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

The way you look at the world starts slowly changing. Especially the many worlds interpretation is a very interesting one.

The detector is switched on for just long enough so that there is 50-50 chance that one of the atoms in the radioactive material will decay. If the detector does record such an event, then the glass bottle is crushed and the cat dies; if not, the cat lives.<br />We have no way of knowing the outcome of this experiment until we open the box to look inside.<br />The whole experiment is governed by the rule that the superposition of both the outcomes of this is real until we look at the experiment, and that only at that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">instant</span> of observation does the decision happen and one of the outcomes is seen.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Many worlds Interpretation</span><br />This theory says that both the outcomes of the experiment are equally real. The surprise is that according to this theory there is not one real cat but <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">two</span>. There is a live cat, and there is a dead cat; but they are located <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">in different worlds</span>.<br />Faced with the decision, the whole world - the universe - split into two versions of itself, identical in all respects except that in one version the atom decayed and the cat died, while in the other the atom did not decay and the cat lived.<br /><br />It sounds like science fiction but it goes far deeper that any science fiction.

It took quite sometime for me to understand it completely. In fact, the meaning flashed to me today during my morning jog!<br /><br />In a programmer\'s perspective, what exactly is <font style=\"font-style: italic;\">data</font>?<br />This is a very subtle concept. Very difficult to explain.<br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Data is something that is constructed and behaves in a particular way. i.e, What data is, is determined by how it behaves.<br />How do you say this programmatically? - Data is that which is defined by constructors and procedures, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation.<br /><br /></div> </div> <font style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example</font>: consider the notion of a \'pair\' in lisp. A \'pair\' is a way of glueing two pieces of data. This is how I will probably explain it:<br /><tt><br />(define z (cons x y))<br /></tt><tt>(car z) => x<br /></tt><tt>(cdr z) => y<br /><br /></tt><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">We never actually said what a pair was, only that there are procedures <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt>, and <tt>cdr</tt> for operating on pairs. But the only thing we need to know about these three operations <a name=\"%_idx_1452\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1454\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1456\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1458\"></a>is that if we glue two objects together using <tt>cons</tt> we can retrieve the objects using <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>.<br />The interesting thing is that any triple of procedures that satisfies the above condition can be used as the basis for implementing pairs. This is one such triple:<br /></div><br /><tt>(define (cons x y)<br />(lambda (m) (m x y)))<br /><br /><a name=\"%_idx_1470\"></a>(define (car z)<br />(z (lambda (p q) p)))</tt><br /><br /><tt>(define (cdr z)<br />(z (lambda (p q) q)))</tt><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This point is illustrated strikingly by the fact that we could implement <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt>, and <tt>cdr</tt> without using any data structures at all but only using procedures. <font style=\"font-style: italic;\">This blurs the distinction between \'procedure\' and \'data\'</font>. Procedure <---> data. Data <---> procedure. Hmm...I need to think.<br /></div>', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

Today my mind is occupied with a lot of other things. This is the background:<br /><br />From the last one year I was working on a large project and somewhat hidden from most of the nitty-gritties of an organization outside the problems of actual delivery of software. From the last one month, since I rolled out of that project, I am opening my eyes to some of these things. I have a few observations to make: This is probably true for any consulting firm. </div><div align=\"justify\"><br /></div><ul><li><div align=\"justify\">The delivery phase is actually just one part of a very large process.</div></li><li><div align=\"justify\">There is a lot of effort by a lot of people that goes in before an assignment actually comes through to the delivery stage. </div></li></ul><p align=\"justify\">I was hearing one of our senior executives talk about these matters (and a lot more things). Everything was so tangled up. Each and every decision which tries to untangle some of these things, brings with it a few more knots as well. As a whole, it is a chaotic environment. If you consider all the multitudes of things that humans are trying to do in this existence, I don\'t see any sort of order in this at all. It feels as though people are trying to make sense out of nonsense. </p><p align=\"justify\">This fact leads to a more general question. Why are human beings in general creating and getting involved in all these complicated situations? What is driving humans to create problems for themselves and solve them and get stuck in this never ending chain?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Money</u> </strong>- This is probably the answer for a vast majority but we see that beyond a certain level, it hardly matters. People sometimes take risks and are ready to lose money for <em>something else</em>.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Ego</u> </strong>- This is probably one factor which overtakes money. People can go to any extent to maintain their self image. Probably this is also one of the factors driving the free software movement. But I feel this is again not the end. There is <em>something else</em>.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Something Else</u> </strong>- I dont know what to call it. It involves the high level of <strong>passion </strong>exhibited by humans in whatever they are interested in. It is the infinite amount of <strong>creativity</strong> hiding inside every human, manifesting at various degrees. The push to do something new and special overflows from everyone given the conducive environment. When that push bursts out from within, neither money nor ego nor anything else can even come near it, let alone constrain it.</p><p align=\"justify\">So, my conclusion is that we humans do what we are doing because <strong><em>we just can\'t help it</em></strong>. The knowledge/creativity/energy inside is trying to breakfree from all the limitations around. It is just the degree of manifestation that causes the differences between man and man.</p>', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

Don\'t be too shocked! - the title is misleading. ok.. let me explain.<br /><br />I was trying out the interfacing of ruby with other languages like C/C++, Java etc and wanted an example. So, I downloaded the C API (<a href=\"http://libyahoo2.sourceforge.net/\">libyahoo2</a>) for yahoo messenger with the idea of writing a wrapper for it in ruby. But I somehow couldn\'t get it working even after trying for almost a week after which I was too frustrated and gave up that idea. In the process, I looked at the C source code and ...hey! I said. Why not...? yes! you guessed it right! It looked as though I could write it in ruby itself from scratch!<br /><br />I started off soon. Now, Yahoo has its own packet strcture to manage communication between its client and server. Or, can you say its own <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html\">Domain specific language</a> in a very crude sense? whatever. I tried to build that packet structure but with no success. The yahoo server doesn\'t respond at all if the packet is not proper i.e. it doesn\'t say that I am wrong. This situation looked as though I was trying to communicate with an extra-terrestrial entity in its own language!<br />It was indeed a very tricky situation.<br /></div><ul><li><div align=\"justify\">You don\'t have tests to tell you what to expect out of your code.</div></li><li><div align=\"justify\">You don\'t know how near you are or how far you are to the solution until you actually get the right solution. </div></li></ul><div align=\"justify\">But finally! after doing a little bit of trial and error and wishful thinking and all that, it <em>actually talked</em> to me! It started sending me the buddy lists, cookies and lots of things.<br /><br />After that it was all normal. I generalised the packet generation and cleaned up my code. Right now I just have made of it a sort of API which can be used to write any sort of client. I have written a small CLI client with just the basic functionality of logging in and sending/receiving messages and typing notifications. Now I am thinking of writing a web-based client using <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">ruby on rails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php\">AJAX</a>.<br /><br />This was quite a useful experiment for me. It made me comfortable with ruby. I learnt a lot about how yahoo messenger works and in general how such asynchronous messaging works. I also recollected socket programming and multi-threaded programming and reading C code ;-).</div>', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

He traced the evolution of the enterprise industry and approaches to enterprise integration, while pointing out interesting observations on how technologies can end up creating more problems than solving it if \"developer convenience\" is prioritised over \"correctness\" of the solution.<br />This was followed by an interesting talk by <a href=\"http://www.erlang-exchange.com/klacke-wikstrom\">Klacke Wikström</a>, about erlang and tail-f systems.<br />After this, there were three parallel tracks for the rest of the day, with a few tutorial sessions.<br /><br /><span>The Enterprise Integration track</span> included talks about <a href=\"http://www.rabbitmq.com/\">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ejabberd.im/\">EJabberD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/index.html\">JInterface</a>, <a href=\"http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/\">CouchDB</a>, etc.<br /><br />There was also a very interesting session by <a href=\"http://www.zib.de/reinefeld\">Alexander Reinefeld</a> on \"Building a transactional distributed data store with Erlang\". Refer to the paper <a href=\"http://www.ist-selfman.org/wiki/images/b/bd/2008-05-scale-challenge.pdf\">here.</a> They have some amazing results on experiments conducted by hosting the entire Wikipedia on a p2p infrastructure, completely built with erlang which scales better with fractional hardware!

The other tutorials were about buiding web applications in erlang, using Faxien and Sinan, and about robotics.<br /><br />The conference concluded with a panel discussion on Erlang enterprise integration. Most people agreed with Joe\'s opinion that erlang needs a killer app to prove to the enterprise before it can be widely accepted. And the lack of libraries for lots of small things was also another reason which would put people off erlang.<br /><br />One thing that everyone in the room was convinced about was that erlang is going to definitely grow big in the coming future. And the erlang community, though quite small as of now, is quite mature and pragmatic in saying \"The right tool for the right Job\" - Using erlang gives tremendous results, only when used for the right things. And this pragmatism, I feel, is a very positive way to look at solving the problems in front of us.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very successful event, thanks to the organizers (<a href=\"http://skillsmatter.com/\">skillsmatter</a> and <a href=\"http://erlang-consulting.com/\">erlang training and consulting</a>) , sponsors, speakers and participants.

The approach of building individual monolithic applications to solve enterprise problems has evolved into an approach of dividing the problem into smaller ones, coming up with different solutions for those and finally having an integration mechanism in place which puts everything together.<br /><br />This approach not only simplifies the problem at hand, but also makes evolution of software easier and reduces the \"single point of failure\" problem with monolithic apps.<br />Well...the valididy of the above statement depends on the way it is done. This approach can lead to probably bigger problems if enough care is not taken at the right times.<br /><br />Talking about the integration bit, there are various approaches to choose from. And <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" class=\"externalLink\">these </a> are the most common ones. File Transfer, Shared Database, Some form of Messaging, etc. Of course, as always, each approach has its pros and cons, but largely, here are my notes on why i feel that the shared database approach seems lika a bad idea.<br /><br />Multiple applications accessing the same database is quite analogous to the shared memory way of implementing concurrent access of data (Consider each application as a thread and all threads accessing a shared data structure which is the database in this case). The shared memory approach comes along with its set of patterns and best practices to be applied for a successful implementation -<br /><ul><li>have as minimal shared data as possible<br /></li><li>synchronizing access to the shared data structure<br /></li><li>not having <i>copies</i> of that shared data in multiple threads<br /></li><li>do as little as possible in the synchronized block (i.e. when the lock has been acquired)<br />-probably just do the actual update of the data and free the lock. No thread should hold the lock for long periods.<br /></li></ul>More details could be found <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/~rsilvafi/papers/FormalMethodsFinalPaper.pdf\" href=\"http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/%7Ersilvafi/papers/FormalMethodsFinalPaper.pdf\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a> (Warning: PDF file)<br /><br />The shared database EAI approach will also involve taking corresponding equivalent precautions, Which in a lot of cases, is tough to achieve. All applications will be talking to the same set of tables - minimizing shared data in this case means restricting use of certain tables by only specific apps and so on - which leaves us with few tables which are used as a communication medium between apps. And again this, over a period of time, tends to spill over and might end up in a situation where apps start talking to unrelated tables.<br /><br />Another common pattern seen in such apps is that the database ends up being used as a queue - filled up by one app and consumed by another.<br /><br />Caching data in the applications takes a serious hit as the data might get stale more often than not. Performance, being the main reason behind caching, goes for a toss too. This is corresponding to the \"not having <i>copies</i> of that shared data in multiple threads\" as mentioned above. Caching it is infact keeping a copy of the global data which might change without notice. What might end up happening is that version checks are done every now and then, or atleast on updates on all tables.<br /><br />Taking a step backward, there are questions about the shared memory way of implementing threads itself.<br /><i>In highly concurrent programs</i>, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_language\" class=\"externalLink\">languages</a> like <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://erlang.org/\" href=\"http://erlang.org/\" class=\"externalLink\">Erlang</a> are preferred over others which provide a shared memory based solution. This is tending towards the messaging approach which erlang uses and hence totally avoids shared data. Again, it depends. Probably a combination of both might be the best solution in some cases as well.<br /><br />Taking one more step backward, looking at this approach in an abstract sense, it can be seen that the data would not encapsulated. All applications have access to all data. It just doesn\'t look like the right way of doing it, unless there are enough justifications for it. It looks similar to having global variables in the code (Which is also avoided as far as possible).<br /><br />Rather, consider that each application talks to its own database (which holds just enough data which only this app concerns itself with) and the different apps communicate by sending messages to each other(which is close to an SOA architecture). A common objection to this approach is: There is a lot of data to be sent across to another application. If XML is used, serialization and deserialization itself becomes an overhead etc etc.<br /><br />My answer to that would probably be: The very fact that a lot of data has to be sent is probably indicating that the responsibilities of the applications should be refined. Maybe there is another application in the middle. Maybe some of the operations exist elsewhere.<br />The crux of the problem is in effectively identifying and conceptualising the applications (or services), just as identifying and conceptualising objects is vital for OO.<br /><br />However, a few good articles about EAI approaches are <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=169483&seqNum=1&amp;rl=1\" href=\"http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=169483&seqNum=1&amp;rl=1\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/IntegrationStylesIntro.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/IntegrationStylesIntro.html\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a>', '2008-10-27 23:41:04')[0m

It was a great way to quickly implement type-ahead Ajax behavior by writing little or no code. By simply adding two lines – one to my controller:\n<pre>auto_complete_for :group, :name</pre>\n\nand another to my form:\n<pre>&lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :group, :name, {}, {:method => :get} %&gt;</pre>\n\nusers of my form were able to easily pick from a long list of group names simply by typing the first few letters. What I love about Rails is not only was I able to implement this complex feature with only 2 lines, but those 2 lines were very easy to read: my controller has to handle “autocompletion for group names” and my form should contain a “text field with auto complete behavior for group names”. It’s very natural and intuitive.\n<p />\n<p>The only ugly detail here is that the “{:method => :get}” hash is required to avoid errors related to form security… without it I get an error like this:</p>\n<pre>ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken):\n /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.1.1/lib/action_controller/request_forgery_protection.rb:86:in \'verify_authenticity_token\'</pre>\n\n<a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-spinoffs/browse_thread/thread/7ed6dbb6bdcabf40/287a90ed28bba7da\">This discussion explains</a> that we can avoid the security exception by forcing the autocomplete request to use GET instead of POST. Note that you also need to change config/routes.rb to map the GET request for the completion values to the autocomplete action in your controller. This is a bit ugly, but not a big deal.\n\n<p />\n<p>However, once I tried adding additional fields to the form I ran into some real trouble. I enhanced my form by adding multiple child model objects; in this case I associated a series of people for each group. That is:</p>\n<pre>class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base`\n belongs_to :group</pre>\n\nand:\n<pre>class Group &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n has_many :people</pre>\n\nFollowing <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/73\">Ryan Bates’ great explanation on railcasts</a> about how to implement a form for both parent and child records at the same time, I ended up with a form that looked like this:\n<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n Group &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :group, :name, {}, {:method =&gt; :get} %&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;% for person in @group.people %&gt;\n &lt;% fields_for \"group[person_attributes][]\", person do |person_form| %&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;\n Person &lt;%= person_form.label :name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;%= text_field_with_auto_complete :person, :name, {:index =&gt; nil}, {:method =&gt; :get} %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;% unless person.new_record? %&gt;\n &lt;%= person_form.hidden_field :id, :index =&gt; nil %&gt;\n &lt;% end %&gt;\n &lt;% end %&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>\n\nThis looks a lot more complicated, but except for the “index => nil” hack (see <a href=\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/75\">part 3 of Ryan’s screen cast</a> for an explanation) the code is very clean and straightforward to understand. We display the group name autocomplete text field as before, and then iterate over the people contained in this group, displaying a new autocomplete text field for each one.\n\n<p /><p>Too bad it doesn’t work! Even worse, this code actually has 3 separate problems:\n\nFirst, the &lt;input&gt; tag generated by text_field_with_auto_complete is not what we want for the child objects. Without autocomplete, we would use:\n<pre>&lt;%= person_form.text_field :name %&gt;</pre>\n\nreferring to the “fields_for” method just above and get this HTML:\n<pre>&lt;input id=\"group_person_attributes__name\" name=\"group[person_attributes][][name]\" size=\"30\" type=\"text\" /&gt;</pre>\n\nBut text_field_with_auto_complete :person, :name, … yields this instead:\n<pre>&lt;input id=\"person__name\" name=\"person[][name]\" size=\"30\" type=\"text\" /&gt;</pre>\n\nalong with CSS and Javascript for the auto complete behavior.\n\n<p /><p>Second, the server side code added to my controller also doesn’t know where to look for the person name value in the actual parameter hash; instead it assumes it will receive the parameter as specified in the &lt;input&gt; above: params[“person”][“name”]. See vendor/plugins/autocomplete/lib/auto_complete.rb for details.</p>\n\n<p /><p>And the last and worst problem of all is that the DHTML/Javascript code inside of controls.js from script.aculo.us assumes that the &lt;input&gt; tag id passed in will be unique on the page. But since we will have many person fields for each group field, the script.aculo.us code will fail trying to location the &lt;input&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags specified by text_field_with_auto_complete.</p>\n\n<p /><p>So what to do? The first time I solved this problem, I simply copied and hard coded the HTML and Javascript produced by the autocomplete plugin into my form erb file. Then I changed it to make it work. I also manually added a function to my controller on the server side to get it to find and process the parameter hash properly. If I were still writing PHP code, then I would probably assume this was sufficient and call it a day. If I happened to be using J2EE for this project, I’d probably look at creating a subclass of the autocomplete plugin somehow and extending/modifying the behavior as necessary. Then I would have yet another class and another JAR file to maintain and worry about – not quite as messy, but still ugly or at best complicated.</p>\n\n<p /><p>There must be a better way! Since I’m using Ruby I don’t need to settle for overly complicated code or ugly code. Instead I’ll try to develop a solution using what seems to me the Ruby philosophy: write the cleanest, tightest code you can that makes sense and then find a way to make it work. In my next post I’ll tell you what happened.</p>\n ', '2008-10-30 12:54:15')[0m

The first problem occurred when I clicked on the new theme and selected “Use Theme.\" I expected to see the new theme or a message in the admin console, but instead got a page full of text:\n<pre>$(\"dialog-box\").update(\"\\u003Cdiv id=\\\"theme-info\\\" class=\\\"clearfix\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Ch3\\u003E\\n Cutline (rhtml) (v1.1)by \\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"http://cutline.tubetorial.com/\\\"\\u003EPearsonified\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n \\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\" id=\\\"close-dialog\\\" onclick=\\\"Dialog.close();\nreturn false;\\\"\\u003Eclose\\u003C/a\\u003E\\n \\u003C/h3\\u003E\\n \\u003Cdiv id=\\\"screenshot\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Cimg\nsrc=\\\"/admin/themes/preview_for/cutline\\\" alt=\\\"Theme preview\\\" title=\\\"Cutline (rhtml) (v1.1)\\\" /\\u003E\\n \\u003Cp\\u003EToday, you can put\nan end to boring default styling and step into a world where your posts will become more artistic, more engaging, and more\ncompelling!\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n \\u003C/div\\u003E\\n \\u003Cdiv id=\\\"theme-options\\\"\\u003E\\n \\u003Cul\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/themes/change_to/cutline\\\"\\u003EUse theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/design?theme=cutline\\\"\\u003EEdit theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca\nhref=\\\"/admin/themes/export/cutline\\\"\\u003EDownload theme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003Cli\\u003E\\u003Ca href=\\\"#\\\"\nonclick=\\\"if (confirm(\'Are you sure you wish to delete this theme stored at \\\\\'themes/site-1/cutline\\\\\'?\')) { new\nAjax.Request(\'/admin/themes/destroy/cutline\', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:\'delete\'}); }; return false;\\\"\\u003EDelete\ntheme\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/li\\u003E\\n \\u003C/ul\\u003E\\n \\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\");\nDialog.current.layout();</pre>\n\nIt looks like the parent window from the admin console was redirected to “/admin/themes/show/cutline” and the meta data/contents of the theme dialog box intended for some javascript was displayed as plain text to me. After staring at this for a while I started looking for help on the Internet and eventually found an article explaining that I needed to make a code change to app/controllers/admin/themes_controller.rb near line 5:\n\n<pre>before_filter :protect_action, :only => [:export, :change_to, :rollback,\n :import]</pre>\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n<pre>before_filter :protect_action, :only => [:export, :rollback]</pre>\n\n<p>One to do item here is to check whether the latest, edge version of Mephisto contains this fix already or not. I’m sure it does. Even after making the change on hostingrails.com I struggled for some more time before realizing that I had to kill any dispatch.fcgi processes running on the server before a code change would take effect. This wasn’t a problem in my local, development setup. Passenger must load and cache Ruby code after the first request. This would be interesting to explore further.</p>\n\n<p>I tried again and this time: success! Finally I was able to switch to the new theme. Excited, I quickly took a look at my new site and saw... nothing! More troubleshooting revealed this error in my production.log file:</p>\n\n<pre>SystemExit (Define INLINEDIR or HOME in your environment and try again):\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:93:in \'abort\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:93:in \'rootdir\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:107:in \'directory\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:277:in \'so_name\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:317:in \'load_cache\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/RubyInline-3.7.0/lib/inline.rb:653:in \'inline\'\n...ruby/gems/1.8/gems/image_science-1.1.3/lib/image_science.rb:84\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:32:in \'gem_original_require\'\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:32:in \'require\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:496:in \'require\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:342:in \'new_constants_in\'\n...rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:496:in \'require\'\n...plugins/attachment_fu/lib/technoweenie/attachment_fu/processors/image_science_processor.rb:1\n...ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:27:in \'gem_original_require\'\netc...</pre>\n\nSome further searching on the Internet revealed that the problem here was that an image library called <a href=\"http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ImageScience.html\">ImageScience</a> requires something called <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinline\">RubyInline</a>. Looking at the stack trace, it seems that the “attachment_fu” plugin uses the ImageScience library. Probably this is used by Mephisto to produce the thumbnail preview images in the Admin->Assets page. The solution in this case is to create a folder on the server for RubyInline, and to set this value near the top of Mephisto’s environment.rb file. Along with my change from last week to force the production environment, the top of config/environment.rb looks like this:\n\n<pre># Uncomment below to force Rails into production mode when\n# you don\'t control web/app server and can\'t set it the proper way\nENV[\'RAILS_ENV\'] ||= \'production\'\nENV[\'INLINEDIR\'] ||= \'inline\'</pre>\n\nI tried again to see my site, and this time still saw a blank page. View->Source revealed that the Ruby code in the view was not being executed. Finally I installed the “mephisto_erb_templates” plugin as instructed by <a href=\"http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/2007/3/21/cutline-theme\">http://mephisto-themes.nanorails.com/2007/3/21/cutline-theme</a>.\n\n<pre>script/plugin install http://svn.nanorails.com/plugins/mephisto_erb_templates/</pre>\n\nNow the theme worked properly. I made a few cosmetic CSS tweaks, picked my own image and ended up with this page.\n ', '2008-10-30 12:54:15')[0m

Last week I setup this web site using <a href=\"http://mephistoblog.com/\">Mephisto</a> on a Rails hosting service (<a href=\"http://www.hostingrails.com/\">hostingrails.com</a>), and expected to get it up and running in just a few minutes; after all, if installing and configuring a PHP blog site in 2005 was easy, certainly doing the same in 2008 with better technology (Rails) should be even easier.</p>\n\n<p>Wrong!</p>\n\n<p>First I created a MySQL database on my production server and called it “mephisto”. Then I set the char set and collation settings using the command line:<pre># mysql -u myusername -p\nmysql> ALTER DATABASE mydatabasename DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8\n COLLATE utf8<em>unicode</em>ci</pre></p>\n\n<p>Since I’m not ready to write my own Rails blog site, I decided to download and setup the latest version of <a href=\"http://mephistoblog.com/download\">Mephisto (0.8 “Drax”)</a>. When I tried to download the TAR file from the 0.8 Drax link using curl I got HTML that redirected me to a different location:</p>\n\n<pre># cat master.tar.gz\n&lt;html>&lt;body>You are being &lt;a href=\"http://github.com/tarballs/technoweenie-\nmephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\">redirected&lt;/a>.&lt;/body>&lt;/html></pre>\n\n<p>Probably this is standard behavior by github and I should have used that directly. I need to stop thinking like a PHP developer! Regardless, it wasn’t much trouble to download the actual Mephisto TAR file:</p>\n\n<pre># curl -O http://github.com/tarballs/\n technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\n# tar xvf technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa.tar.gz\n# mv technoweenie-mephisto-90e2cc253d94e2e544bc8b21f361c7360c1e9baa mephisto</pre>\n\n<p>No big deal; so far this was a very similar experience to setting up a PHP web site: create the database, download the code and you’re almost done. Next, I entered the proper values in database.yml and tried to initialize the database:</p>\n\n<pre># rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production\n(in /home/myusername/mephisto)\nYour config/boot.rb is outdated: Run \"rake rails:update\".</pre>\n\n<p>It was at this point that my problems started. First I wasn’t sure why I received this error message at all. Next I tried to use rails:update to fix it as instructed and ran into further trouble. A couple of hours and 5 or 10 blog posts later I discovered the solution <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/MephistoBlog/browse_thread/thread/a03e8ac350382e0e\">here in this great write up</a>. It turns out that Mephisto 0.8 does not work with Rails 2.1 and I needed to downgrade to Rails 2.0.2. Since I’m using a shared server on hostingrails.com I used rails:freeze:edge to get the proper version of Rails installed in my app’s folder:</p>\n\n<pre># rake rails:freeze:edge RELEASE=2.0.2\nDownloading Rails from http://dev.rubyonrails.org/archives/rails_2.0.2.zip\nUnpacking Rails\nUpdating current scripts, javascripts, and configuration settings</pre>\n\n<p>At this point I tried to initialize the database again but this time got a different error:</p>\n\n<pre># rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production\n(in /home/myusername/mephisto)\nrake aborted!\nundefined method \'install_gem_spec_stubs\' for #&lt;Rails::Initializer:0xb7c652e8></pre>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/MephistoBlog/browse_thread/thread/a03e8ac350382e0e\">explained here</a>, I still had to manually copy one file from Rails to my application which rails:freeze:edge didn’t handle properly, using this command from my app\'s folder:</p>\n\n<pre># cp vendor/rails/railties/environments/boot.rb config/boot.rb</pre>\n\n<p>Finally I was able to run rake db:bootstrap successfully! The last bit of configuration I had to do was to add this line to config/environment.rb in order to insure hostingrails.com used the production configuration:</p>\n\n<pre># Uncomment below to force Rails into production mode when\n# you don\'t control web/app server and can\'t set it the proper way\nENV[\'RAILS_ENV\'] ||= \'production\'</pre>\n\n<p>After creating a symlink and doing some other <a href=\"http://www.hostingrails.com/forums/wiki_thread/1\">standard configuration for hostingrails.com</a>, I was finally able to get my site up and running. It was a lot harder than configuring a PHP site and ruined a whole evening, but in the end wasn’t all that bad.</p>\n ', '2008-10-30 12:54:15')[0m

It’s a great way to get an interactive, community web site such as a blog or discussion forum up and running quickly without writing any code. But Drupal is a poor choice for general, complex web application development for a few simple reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn’t use a standard, general software architecture such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) like Rails or Struts.</li>\n<li>Drupal doesn’t employ or support modern development best practices such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a> or automated testing more generally. (Exception: the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/simpletest\">SimpleTest</a> module can provide some automated integration testing using HTTP without opening a real browser.)</li>\n<li>While the module API does allow for some customization, it can be easy to get into trouble if your target application is outside of Drupal’s design center. Specifically, you may end up having to modify Drupal’s core code or database schema when Drupal doesn’t behave the way you would like.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A better choice for more general or complex web development would be Ruby on Rails.</p>\n\n<p>If you do need to develop a custom web application using the Drupal framework, you can avoid problems #2 and #3 by using a test driven approach. Instead of simply implementing your custom logic by writing PHP code to the Drupal module API, try pulling your custom code out of Drupal entirely and running it independently of the framework. This will insure that your custom code could someday be run with another web framework and also help you avoid the temptation of modifying Drupal’s core code directly. Of course, you will also get all of the normal benefits of TDD: better design oriented around business requirements, live documentation through executable code, etc.</p>\n\n<p>How to do this? Write tests first using PHPUnit (which fail), then get your tests to pass by implementing the desired behavior using PHP 5 objected oriented code. Lastly, write a “shell” module that calls out to your test driven object oriented PHP code from Drupal. This means your code will be run twice: once from the command line by PHPUnit during development and from your CI process, and again from Drupal to process end user requests in production.</p>\n\n<p>In a series of future posts I\'ll write a Drupal module using TDD, using a few tips and tricks along the way to get PHPUnit and Drupal to play together nicely.</p>\n ', '2008-10-30 12:54:15')[0m

Meaning Class A does not depend on how class b is implemented and so on. In a system, YAGNI would manifest itself when a developer would want provide some type of feature that they feel the business will eventually need OR introduce a measure of complexity just for \"when\" things change drastically.\n</p>\n<p>\nI think the simplest example would be factories for the creation of every different type in a system\n(I am not sure why many have such a desire to abstract a constructor)\n\nAt this point YAGNI (if it were a person) would say stick to the simplest code to implement the task and do only what the users/business ask for.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut we can still designing a system for the future without requiring additional complexity by:\n<ul>\n<li>narrowing down interfaces and responsibilities of class</li>\n<li>Creating Behavior in a way so that it can be leveraged in other contexts</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\nSo what does that mean, lets take an example of Filtering an collection of object based on some criteria\n\nLets say we have a filter class that should filter items based on its location. It can filter anything that implements IsupportLocationFiltering\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportLocationFiltering\n{\n State GetState();\n}\n\n\nclass FilterRule\n{\n private readonly State TargetState;\n\n public IList Filter(IList itemsToFilter)\n {\n IList filteredItems = new ArrayList();\n foreach(IsupportLocatinFiltering supporter in itemsToFilter)\n	if(items.GetState() == TagetState) filteredItems.Add(supporter)\n return filteredItems;\n }\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe above FilterRule breaks encapsulation and therefore is not designed for the future. The reason being is the filter asks for the State and proceeds to compare it against the state that we want to find items from. First we are assuming that all types that implement ISupportLocationFiltering can be filtered by matching states. Maybe we match states for all objects today but tomorrow what if we introduce a new type that can support \"Location Filtering\" but is done by checking to see if a zip code is from the\ntarget state. We can easily accommodate this by using encapsulation without adding complexity and achieving flexibility.\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportLocationFiltering\n{\n bool IsIn(State state);\n}\n\n\nclass FilterRule\n{\n private readonly State TargetState;\n\n public IList Filter(IList itemsToFilter)\n {\n IList filteredItems = new ArrayList();\n foreach(IsupportLocatinFiltering supporter in itemsToFilter)\n	if(items.IsIn(TagetState)) filteredItems.Add(supporter)\n return filteredItems;\n }\n}\n</pre>\n\nNow its up to each implementation of ISupportLocationFiltering to know if it can be filtered by a state. Our Interface is much more useful then just for filtering so we can accommodate future changes by renaming it to something more useable\n\n<pre>\ninterface ISupportALocation\n{\n bool IsIn(State state);\n}\n</pre>', '2008-10-30 12:54:16')[0m

It will take time to take Ruby/LAMP to the same place (engineering, development, support) as Java/J2EE in IT.<br />- Managing/supporting Mongrel is painful: Passenger mod_rails is an attractive solution as it simplifies deployment of Ruby applications.

Why should one use MySQL then? Does it matter? If so, where/what and how much?<br />- MySQL is primary database for most open source software (including Ruby) and hence some software components (plugins etc.) only work on MySQL (at least in early phases)<br />- MySQL enables agile development practices<br />- Enterprise/core/reused datasets vs. \"Application\" datasets<br /><br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How will we choose between Java and Ruby?</span><br />- We plan to continue maintaining our Java apps using existing technology (Java/J2EE)<br />- For new apps, I suggest Ruby as the starting point considering our internal needs...Here\'s why:<br />Java offers high efficiency of execution with byte code compilation (JVM), whereas Ruby offers simplicity, maintainability and productivity gains. Most internal apps can be developed using Ruby unless complex integration with Java systems is needed.<br />(a) Most internal enterprise apps are simple and don’t require high efficiency of execution (e.g. many thousands of users and high-volume, real-time data processing)<br />(b) Performance gains from Ruby to Java aren’t significant from end-user perspective (server-side performance is negligible from end-user perspective)<br /></li></ol><br /><br />This discussion in IT raises some important questions?<br /><ul><li>Should we leverage existing infrastructure (Oracle, Java/J2EE (JRuby)) for deploying Ruby applications?</li><li>Is/should MySQL be at par with Oracle in the enterprise?</li><li>Is/should LAMP be at par with J2EE in the enterprise?</li><li>?<br /></li></ul><br />How are you dealing with this in your IT department?', '2008-10-30 12:54:17')[0m

I asked these developers if they found it to be more useful to start testing from the bottom-up or top-down. I suggested to them that, since Rails uses the <a href=\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller\'>MVC pattern</a>, it\'s easy to think of the view, or user interface, as the \"top\", and the model as the \"bottom\". Surprisingly, nearly every developer that I asked this question of answered that they prefer to start from the bottom, or model, and test upwards. <em>Nearly every one!</em> I expected that I\'d get a much more mixed response than I have. In fact, I think that the correct place to start testing is <em>precisely</em> at the highest level possible, to reduce the risk of building software based on incorrect assumptions of how best to solve a user requirement.</p>\n\n<h1>Bottom-up Testing</h1>\n\n<p>Bottom-up testing implies bottom-up design in TDD. In bottom-up design, a developer would probably consider the high-level objectives and break them up into manageable components that interact with each other to provide the desired functionality. The developer thinks about how each component will be used by its client components, and tests accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with the bottom-up approach is that it\'s difficult to really know how a component needs to be used by its clients until the clients are implemented. To consider how the clients will be implemented, the developer must also think about how those clients will be used by <em>their</em> clients. This thought process continues until we reach the summit of our mighty design! Hopefully, when the developer is done pondering, they can write a suite of tests for a component which directly solves the needs of its client components. In my experience, however, this is rarely the case. What really happens is that the lower-level components tend either to do too much, too little, or the right amount in a way that is awkward or complicated to make use of.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of bottom-up testing is that, since we\'re starting with the most basic, fundamental components, we guarantee that we\'ll have some working software fairly quickly. However, since the software being written may not be closely associated with the high-level user requirements, it may not produce results that are necessarily valuable to the user. A simple client could quickly be written which demonstrates how the components work to the user, but that\'s besides the point unless the application being developed is a simple application. In such a case, the bottom-level of components are probably close enough to the top-level ones that there is little risk involved in choosing either the bottom-up or top-down approach.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you\'re writing a small application, the code is probably going to have to support unforeseen use cases. When this comes as a result of ungrounded assumptions about the software that\'s already been written, this can mean a lot of rework. I can tell you from experience, once you realize that your lower-level components don\'t fit the bill for the higher levels in the system, it can be quite a chore to go back and fix, remove, or replace all of that unnecessary or incorrect code.</p>\n\n<h1>Top-down Testing</h1>\n\n<p>Top-down testing implies top-down design in TDD. Following the top-down approach, the developer will pick the highest level of the system to be tested; that is to say, the part of the system that has the closest correlation to the user requirements. This approach is sometimes referred to as <a href=\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development\'>Behavior Driven Development</a>. Whatever it\'s called, the point is that you test the most critical parts of the application first. </p>\n\n<p>Since software is often written for human users, the most critical parts usually involve the front-end as it relates to the value being provided by the system being developed. When testing from the top-down, the effort is the inverse of bottom-up testing: Instead of spending a lot of time thinking about how the components to be developed will be used by other components to be developed, the focus is on how the user needs to interact with the system. Testing involves proving that the system supports the required usability. For an application with a graphical front-end, this might involve testing for a minimal version of that front-end.</p>\n\n<p>The disadvantage of top-down testing is that you can end up with a lot of <a href=\'http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/01/12/mocking-net-http-get\'>stubbed</a> or <a href=\'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object\'>mocked</a> code that you then have to go back and implement. This means it might take longer before you have software that actually does something besides pass tests. However, there are ways that you can minimize this sort of recursive development problem. </p>\n\n<p>One way to minimize the time between starting development of a feature and demonstrating functionality that is valuable to the user is to focus on a thin slice of the overall architectural pie of the application. For example, there may be a number of views that need to be implemented before the system provides some major piece of functionality. However, the developer can focus on one view at a time, or one part of the view. That way, the number of components that need to be implemented before the system does something useful is small; ideally, one component in each architectural layer that I need build out, and often times only a part of the overall functionality of each component.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to minimize the amount of time before the system does something useful is to code a small bit of functionality without worrying about breaking the problem up into classes until you have some tested, working code to analyze. You can then use established methods for <a href=\'http://www.refactoring.com/\'>refactoring</a> to bring the code to an acceptable level of quality.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of top-down testing is that you write functionality that solves the most critical functionality first. This generally means starting development at a high level. When the system eventually does something besides pass tests, what it does will provide value to its users. Additionally, because development starts at a high level, the code that is written is based on the current understanding of the problem, and not on assumptions. This guarantees that the tests and code that are written are not superfluous.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>The challenge with top-down testing is that you must be highly disciplined to ensure that the code you write is being refactored and is properly evolving into a cohesive domain model for the application. This is compared with bottom-up testing, where you start with the domain model and build your system around it. Either way, you\'re going to be refactoring code. The difference is in where the time in refactoring is spent. In my experience, when doing bottom-up testing, more time is spent correcting incorrect assumptions about how the domain model will be used than on actually improving code that already works to solve the user requirements. In order to avoid making assumptions about the code being written, it must be written at the level that is closest to providing actual value to the end-user. In so doing, the developer focuses on continuous refinement of code that already provides value, as opposed to speculative design and development.</p> ', '2008-10-30 12:54:27')[0m

Other times, I don\'t have control over the lighting, like in a dim pub or cafe. In dim lighting, it\'s a strain on my eyes to be looking at black text on a white background. I\'ve tried dimming the brightness, but that decreases the contrast, which is also a strain on my eyes. Then, I discovered Control+Option+Command+8, which is a keyboard shortcut to the \"Reverse black and white\" Universal Access feature. Contrary to it\'s name, it does more than reverse black and white, it reverses all of the colors on the screen. This, however, is acceptable and requires only a slight mental adjustment for me. Now I use a nice black-on-white color scheme in TextMate for coding, and when I\'m in dim lighting, I simply reverse the colors and it\'s white-on-black, still full-contrast. I\'m happy, except for one thing.</p>\n\n<p>I often have a number of Terminal windows open when I\'m working, and I open and close them frequently. Although I\'m happy with a black-on-white color scheme for TextMate, I can\'t tolerate anything but white-on-black for my normal Terminal windows. So, what happens when I throw the screen colors in reverse is that all of my lovely white-on-black Terminal windows go to black-on-white. Unacceptable! Thus began my first foray into AppleScript.</p>\n\n<p>After referencing <a href=\'http://lists.apple.com/archives/Cocoa-dev/2006/Jun/msg01433.html\'>here</a>, <a href=\'http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/aplscptian/chapter/ch07.html\'>here</a>, and <a href=\'http://developer.apple.com/applescript/\'>here</a>, along with the Terminal \"dictionary\", I came up with this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tell application \"System Events\"\n tell application processes\n key code 28 using {command down, option down, control down}\n end tell\nend tell\n\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n if default settings is equal to settings set \"White on Black\" then\n set settingsSet to \"Black on White\"\n else if default settings is equal to settings set \"Black on White\" then\n set settingsSet to \"White on Black\"\n end if\n set default settings to settings set settingsSet\n repeat with w in every window\n set current settings of w to settings set settingsSet\n end repeat\nend tell\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This script first invokes the Control+Option+Command+8 keyboard shortcut to reverse the screen colors. It then toggles the default \"settings set\" for Terminal to one of two pre-defined sets I\'ve created: \"White on Black\" and \"Black on White\". Hopefully the names are self-explanatory. Then, the script iterates over all currently-open Terminal windows and changes their current \"settings set\" to whatever the new default is. </p>\n\n<p>Pretty simple. I named the script \"Reverse Screen Colors\" and dropped it in /Users/[user account]/Library/Scripts. I invoke it via the keyboard with <a href=\'http://www.blacktree.com/\'>QuickSilver</a>.</p> ', '2008-10-30 12:54:27')[0m

Due to the way that the koans are structured, I wasn\'t able to find a way to make a single koan pass at a time.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve addressed this shortcoming by restructuring the koans so that the problem can be solved incrementally, <em>one koan at a time</em>. While restructuring the koans, I wrote a solution to each in turn, and saved that solution to its own knowledge file. Each file is a small refactoring from the one before it, ultimately building up to the final solution.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of future training sessions, I\'ve also started adding documentation to each refactoring, explaining how it changed from the previous one, and why it changed the way it did. The documentation isn\'t complete yet, but it\'s a start.</p>\n\n<p>The restructured MetaKoans, along with the individual refactorings of my solution, can be found at <a href=\'http://svn.ryankinderman.net/metakoans_training\'>http://svn.ryankinderman.net/metakoans_training</a>. Feel free to check it out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A little explanation</strong></p>\n\n<p>You\'ll notice that the knowledge files in my solution follow the pattern: <code>knowledge_for_koan_XX_Y.rb</code>. The XX number is the koan that the knowledge is a solution for. The Y number is the ordered refactoring index, with 1 being the first, most straight-forward solution, and subsequent indices being refinements of the original.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this structuring is that, often times, the straight-forward, brute-force solution to a koan isn\'t always the optimal solution. So, I\'d make refactorings to show how the code could, IMHO, be improved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks go to <strong>ara.t.howard</strong> for coming up with the original MetaKoans quiz. It\'s been an extremely informative tool for myself and many others.</p> ', '2008-10-30 12:54:27')[0m

I\'m not sure exactly which revision it was; one from version 4.0.2 I believe. Finding bugs so frequently probably has something to do with the fact that my idea of \"upgrading\" is doing an <code>svn up</code> from <a href=\'http://trac.typosphere.org/browser/trunk\'>trunk</a> and running <code>db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</code>. Anyways, each time this happens, I end up spending at least 2 hours getting into \"Typo debug mode\", once getting passed \"oh crap my blog is screwed mode\", and fixing the problem. I don\'t mind debugging Typo. Having to do it now and then wouldn\'t be a problem if the types of problems I found were edge cases; unfortunately, they\'re usually not. These are things that, most definitely, should be covered by unit tests somewhere and caught when they get broken. This time around, I found three issues of this type.</p>\n\n<p>The first issue was as simple as forgetting to update the values in the <code>state</code> column of the <code>contents</code> table in or before database migration 058. These values apparently were valid at some point with values such as <code>ContentState::Ham</code>, <code>ContentState::Spam</code>, <code>ContentState::Published</code>, and so on. However, they are now supposed to be simply <code>ham</code>, <code>spam</code>, and <code>published</code>, respectively. Not updating this data causes migration 058 to fail with Content complaining about an invalid state value. I had to go into mysql and update the values manually.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem is also a simple oversight. After running migration 058, all comments are now stored in a table called <code>feedback</code>. Fine. However, whereas before the comments were displayed in the blog, after running the migration, you\'ll notice that they\'re not. This is because there is a <code>published</code> field in the <code>feedback</code> table that indicates whether a comment should be shown or not. After running migration 058, the value of this field for all comments on the blog is 0 (zero), which causes a comment to not be shown. Simply set this value to 1, and the comments are back again.</p>\n\n<p>The third issue, which I discovered by accident from having a <code>tail -f log/production.log</code> running whilst fixing the first bug. I noticed that, every once in a while, a request would come in for <code>Parameters: {\"action\"=&gt;\"show\", \"id\"=&gt;\"some_category\", \"controller\"=&gt;\"categories\"}</code>, which would result in an <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</code> error to be raised from <code>Category.find_by_permalink</code>. I noticed that the value of <code>params[:id]</code> was actually the name of a tag, not a category. So, I traced the error to Tag.permalink_url, which looked like this:</p>\n\n<p>File: typo/app/models/tag.rb</p>\n\n<pre><code>def permalink_url(anchor=nil, only_path=true)\n blog = Blog.find(1) # remove me...\n\n blog.url_for(\n :controller =&gt; \'categories\',\n :action =&gt; \'show\',\n :id =&gt; permalink\n )\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Woops! I guess we don\'t want to construct a URL for <code>CategoriesController</code> as the permalink for a <em>Tag</em>. I just changed <code>:controller =&gt; \'categories\'</code> to <code>:controller =&gt; \'tags\'</code> and the problem was fixed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Addendum</em>: Updated this entry to include a description of and resolution to the issue with the <code>feedback.published</code> database field.</p> ', '2008-10-30 12:54:27')[0m

I got it when I started getting deep into the Ruby/Rails stuff. Being a developer, I use a lot of unix-y command-line tools, server software, and so on. The best way to install these types of things is to use some sort of package manager, such as <a href=\'http://finkproject.org/\'>Fink</a> or <a href=\'http://www.macports.org/\'>MacPorts</a>, the latter being the one I\'ve chosen to use. With MacPorts, I can install, upgrade, or uninstall most of the open source apps that I love in Linux. However, there\'s a catch to MacPorts\' ease of use: it doesn\'t clean up the packages that it downloads when you install/upgrade/uninstall an app unless you tell it to.</p>\n\n<p>An example of an app that I installed recently that would be a pain to compile/install using a traditional build script is Tomcat 5. Tomcat 5 has 20+ library dependencies, some of which have their dependencies of their own. When I ran <code>sudo port install tomcat5</code>, it took about 20 minutes or so to download and compile everything. However, I never had to do anything else. I literally walked away and checked back periodically until it was done. </p>\n\n<p>Today I decided that, since I was only using Tomcat for occasional development, I\'d rather have it, and its plethora of dependencies, installed on a Linux VM instead of my real machine, so it didn\'t sit there eating up resources all the time. So, I went through and uninstalled everything. But I noticed a while ago that there was a \'clean\' command for MacPorts that removed the downloaded packages from an install of an app, and I was curious about whether or not my uninstalling of Tomcat and it\'s dependencies resulted in these packages being auto-cleaned. So, I took a look in <code>/opt/local/var/macports/distfiles</code> and was surprised to find that the install packages for most of the apps I\'ve ever installed/upgraded/uninstalled were still there! </p>\n\n<p>Now, since these packages mainly consist of compressed source code, it\'s not going to eat up a lot of hard drive space. But, I had quite a few built up, and would rather not have them sitting there for no reason. Rather than go through and \'clean\' each one individually, I created a bash script to do this for me for all packages represented in the <code>distfiles</code> directory. Since I know a few people who use MacPorts that aren\'t exactly savvy with *nix command-line tools, I thought I\'d share it:</p>\n\n<p>File: clean_ports</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\nls -1 /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles | \\\nawk \'{\n if ($1 !~ /^./) {\n system(\"port clean --all \" $1)\n }\n}\'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just throw this into a file and then run <code>chmod +x clean_ports</code> to make it executable. Now you can just periodically run <code>clean_ports</code> to avoid unnecessary build-up of the remnants of MacPorts installs.</p>\n\n<p><em>Addendum</em>: Aaron Schaefer mentioned in the comments that this same thing can be done using MacPorts pseudo-portnames. So, the simpler solution is to do: <code>sudo port clean --all installed</code></p> ', '2008-10-30 12:54:27')[0m

Most offshore outsourcing firms view software development as a manufacturing problem. I don\'t think this way though. You don\'t think this way. In fact the midwest doesn\'t think this way about software. Cray doesn\'t manufacture it’s compilers, it crafts them. DowJones doesn\'t manufacture it\'s systems, it crafts them. They\'re crafted by craftsmen using tools they have often built themselves. Quality is a focus.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally the cost of living here is reasonable compared to either coast. I travel to New York often and stay in a basic room at the Waldorf Astoria in Midtown. It costs around $350 - $400 a month. For that same price I can get a two room suite at The Saint Paul Hotel. I get twice as much hotel here in Saint Paul compared to New York. The same is true for software development. In fact with raising prices in India year after year, the price difference per hour can be as little as $20 and as high as $50. Though on average it\'s around $25 to $35 and hour. That price difference is even less once you take into account soft costs. For example having only one hour time difference, common language, ability to meet in person cheaply (thank you <a href=\"http://www.suncountry.com\">SunCountry</a>). By far the best benefit is talent though. Developers in the midwest are using the best and latest technologies, have access to a number of mentors, conferences and user groups. Did I also mention developers in the Midwest can produce nearly twice as fast as those in India. If this speed is included, developers in the Midwest are actually cheaper and of course, developers in the Midwest focus on quality.</p>\n\n<p> This is the essence of what I call Farmsourcing. This combination of reasonable developer costs, developers that focus on quality, increased productivity and proximity to fields of corn. So how does it work? After all good talent isn\'t cheap. My solution, use unpolished talent, pay them lower wages, mentor them for 1 to 2 years and then get them a better job somewhere else. This solution has problems though - some similar to those India faces.</p>\n\n<p> First I need to find a good source of unpolished talent. For that we have new CS grads from universities like the <a href=\"http://www.umn.edu\">U</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stthomas.edu\">St. Thomas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.macalester.edu/\">Macalester</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metrostate.edu\">Metro State</a> and so on. Let me qualify what I mean by unpolished talent. I define it as someone who understands the concepts but doesn’t know how to implement them.</p>\n\n<p> Second problem is the lower wages. I pay anywhere from $20 to $40 an hour and most times closer to $25. Why would someone work for these lower wages? Let me ask you this question. Why would someone pay to go to grad school? Most likely because they want the final education that will set them apart. Well that\'s what I’m offering: grad school expect they don’t pay - I pay them. Here’s what I tell prospective employees: come work for me for one to two years, I\'ll pay you a decent but lower wage during that time. But I will also mentor you on everything from version control systems and continuous integration to project management and contracting. At the end of the one to two years you\'ll not only be able to get a job worth twice as much but I\'ll help you find it.</p>\n\n<p> The third problem is how to actually mentor barely functional into quite good? Or put another way, how do you scale your team? I\'m not going to go into the details of this since this process is our secret to success. But I\'ll say it\'s a combination of three things: The mentors, the process tools and <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">Ruby on Rails</a>. The latter of which I\'ll talk more about.</p>\n\n<p> Rails really makes this happen. First, I can explain <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org\">Ruby</a> to someone in just a couple days. There isn\'t even a book they have to buy to learn it. Try that with C++. Second, Rails is very opinionated. So long as you do things the Rails Way life is easy. When you don\'t, things get hard. It acts like a warning light for newbies when they’re doing something they shouldn’t. I tell them, if it\'s hard, ask a mentor. Third, Rails is Ikea. It has darn near everything you need already so there is no need to build it. This is good for a couple reasons: it makes apps smaller so statistically there should be less bugs, you can produce faster because you don\'t need to build it, and all the code in Rails acts as a nice reference when you do need to build something yourself. Fourth, Rails has testing built in. You need tests when working with barely functionals. Fifth, there is no compile step in Ruby and thus encourages what if exploration which results in deeper learning.</p>\n\n<p>Because of Ruby on Rails and Farmsourcing I no longer worry about the enterprise and every manager and CIO I talk with about Farmsourcing with Ruby on Rails worries less too. They also quickly find a project to try it out on. How big can Farmsourcing get? I’m not sure but what I do know is outsourcing is a $20 billion business and I’m not quite there yet. So if you have capital to invest so we can faster and keep up with demand or are interested in a job, please contact me.</p>\n <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=RyRfyI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=RyRfyI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=Q9j8ki\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=Q9j8ki\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>', '2008-10-30 12:54:28')[0m

They have offices in pretty much every country I can think of. During that time I\'ve been working to get them up to speed with Ruby on Rails. This has included getting their outsourced offshore team up to speed as well. What I want to do is share some conclusions I\'ve made from this experience. I gave a talk about this at <a href=\"http://minnebar.org\">Minnebar</a> but wasn\'t able to discuss everything and hope to do so here. What I want to talk about is:\n<ul>\n <li>Why enterprises are outsourcing</li>\n <li>How outsourcing to an offshore team fails them</li>\n <li>Why farmsourcing is better</li>\n <li>How Ruby on Rails seals the deal</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>I use to make fun of the enterprise. That is until I gained a deeper understanding of them. Truth is, they\'re in a rough spot and it\'s this difficulty that sends them outsourcing to an offshore team. It hasn\'t been my experience enterprises desire to do this. They’re not ignorant of the problems this has. They\'re just often left without a choice. Most enterprises have a large backlog of projects for a large number of users. On top of this, enterprises also have problems finding talent especially when trying to compete with benefits like free food, flexible hours, working from home and the chance to make it rich in options that many startups offer. Most daunting to an enterprise though is an increased frustration of users. Users expect their internal apps to work like external apps. Users want their intranet to work like Facebook and their messaging to work like Twitter. Given these difficulties, enterprises look for an escape. They realize their developers can’t make it happen in time. Not because their developers aren’t capable (though quite a few are indeed incapable) but because they\'re so busy just making what already exists just work. Add to this the need to control the bottom line and impossible becomes a real way of summing up the problem. This is why the escape enterprises often go for is outsourcing to an offshore team.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is outsourcing to an offshore team will allow an enterprise to work some projects on the backlog while keeping costs down. Notice I didn’t mention anything about quality. That\'s because when you pick outsourcing you also pick to control time and scope and leave quality to the outsourced developers. <b>The real failure of outsourcing firms is ignoring the fact that they are responsible for quality.</b> Of course there are other problems with offshoring like:\n<ul>\n<li>Timezone Issues</li>\n<li>Poor Communication</li>\n<li>Most use old technology which often result in delivering old technology</li>\n<li>Desire to do what ever the client asks even if it doesn\'t make sense</li>\n<li>Lack of talent - no mentoring</li>\n</ul>\n\nBut the real problem I argue is quality. Don\'t believe me? Ask these questions of any developer working for an offshore outsourcing firm. (Note if they can answer them, keep them)\n<ul>\n	<li>What is the last programming language/API you learn?</li>\n	<li>What programming blogs do you ready daily?</li>\n	<li>Who do you ask when you have a question on code style? Who does that person ask?</li>\n	<li>What are two or three bad coding practices?</li>\n	<li>Why is testing important?</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>Quality is not important because most offshore outsourcing firms see programming as manufacturing and not as craftsmanship. They believe two teams working off the same requirements will result in the exact same application. This thinking is why offshore outsourcing often fails. Quality is ignored in favor of scope and time resulting. So when enterprises finally get the application it only works so long as you click on the right things in the right order and don’t ever try to add a feature, modify a page or upgrade a component because the application was manufactured and not crafted.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t think this way and everyone at <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=minnebar&amp;m=tags\">Minnebar</a> doesn\'t think this way. In fact the midwest as a whole doesn\'t think this way. For us it\'s about crafting software, not manufacturing it. For this reason I suggest enterprises Farmsource which I\'ll talk about in my next post.</p>\n <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=vGXWRH\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=vGXWRH\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?a=RKxPlh\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/mmmultiworks?i=RKxPlh\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>', '2008-10-30 12:54:28')[0m

Overall RSpec Stories are an incredibly powerful tool and have allowed us to take a huge step towards business analysts writing functional specifications (in the form of plain text stories) then allowing the developers to make them pass. Today I\'d like to share how we setup our stories and some of the decisions we made along the way.<br /><br />The first goal was to run the stories from rake so we created a rake task in <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">lib/tasks/stories.rake</span> to run the stories and fail if any of them fail - this was useful when running this from our cruise server.<br /><pre><br /> task :all do<br /> args = ENV[\'story_prefix\'] || \'\'<br /> stories_passed = system \'ruby\', File.join(RAILS_ROOT, \"stories\", \"run_with_all_steps.rb\"), args<br /> raise(\'story failed\') unless stories_passed<br /> end<br /></pre><br />You can invoke this task as <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">rake stories:all</span> or <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">rake stories:all story_prefix=user_</span> and the second variant allow you to run just one (or a subset) of the stories which turned out to be useful as they take a long time to run. Now we\'ll move onto <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">stories/run_with_all_steps.rb</span> which is what actually runs the stories.<br /><br />First some setup of the environment since we\'re invoked from the command line<br /><pre><br /> file_pattern = ARGV[0] || \"*\"<br /> ENV[\"RAILS_ENV\"] = \"test\"<br /> require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + \"/../config/environment\")<br /> require \'spec/rails/story_adapter\'<br /></pre><br />Then two helper functions that load all stories in a directory or use the story_pattern passed in. This is something I haven\'t seen other people do with the RSpec story framework but seemed natural to me as I didn\'t want to have to maintain a list of stories to run and possibly (or probably) forget to add new ones. Stories also have a concept of steps that go along with stories but I didn\'t want to have to to manually associate steps with stories so decided to load them all. There were some clashes with different step files using the same phrase to define their steps but when that happened we just changed the phrasing of one or the other. The only trick in here is the sort on the step_files which was required because windows and the mac and linux loaded the files in a different order causing inconsistency across machines.<br /><pre><br /> def all_local_stories(story_pattern = \"\")<br /> story_path = \"#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/stories\"<br /> Dir[File.expand_path(\"#{story_path}/**/#{story_pattern}*.story\")]<br /> end<br /><br /> def all_steps_for_local_stories<br /> steps_path = \"#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/steps\"<br /> step_files = Dir[File.expand_path(\"#{steps_path}/*.rb\")].sort<br /> step_files.collect do |file|<br /> require file<br /> file.match(/(\\w+)\\.rb\\Z/).captures[0].underscore.to_sym<br /> end<br /> end<br /></pre><br />Lastly we invoke the rspec story runner. What\'s tricky here is that the story runner doesn\'t run here but registers itself using <a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Kernel.html#M005958\">Kernel.at_exit</a> (which I\'d never seen before)<br /><pre><br /> stories = all_local_stories(file_pattern)<br /> stories.each do |file|<br /> with_steps_for(*all_steps_for_local_stories) do<br /> run file, :type => RailsStory<br /> end<br /> end<br /></pre><br />So up to here we can invoke our stories using rake ... but what are stories and how do they work? Stories are just text files written with the template<br /><pre><br />Story: Manage Users<br />As an Administrator<br />I want to manage the users who have access to my application<br />So that private stuff isn\'t seen by the wrong people<br /><br /> Scenario: Revoke access for a user<br /> Given Alex is a registered user<br /> When I delete the user Alex<br /> Then Alex should not be able to access the sensitive content<br /></pre><br />This is pretty cool ... so how does it work? This is where the steps come in. We define a steps file to match each of the Given/When/Then clauses in our story and define what to do for each one.<br /><pre><br />require File.dirname(__FILE__) + \'/../../../spec/spec_helper\'<br /><br />steps_for(:user_management) do<br /> Given(\'$user_name is a registered user\') do |user_name|<br /> @users ||= []<br /> @users << name =\"\"> user_name})<br /> end<br /><br /> When(\'I delete the user $user_name\') do |user_name|<br /> this_user = @users.detect {|a_user| a_user.name == user_name}<br /> this_user.should_not be_nil<br /> this_user.destroy<br /> end<br /><br /> Then(\'$user_name should not be able to access the site\') do |user_name|<br /> get(\"/login?username=#{user_name}\")<br /> response.response_code.should == 401<br /> end<br />end<br /></pre><br />As the rspec story runner parses the story file it looks for a step that matches invokes its block passing a parameter for each $-starting variable in the clause. The way I\'ve written what\'s above we try to maintain some consistency between the variables referred to in the different clauses. If you refer to the user_name as \'Alex\' in the Given clause we store that user away in the <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">@users</span> array and load it from there later on when we want to refer to the same user in the When clause.<br /><br />We\'ve had pretty good success working with stories in this way and as we move forward are going to continue to experiment with<br /><ul><li>Having our business analysts write most of the story files and the developers write the steps.<br /></li><li>Thinking of ways to keep the steps files DRY</li><li>Working with WATIR or Selenium to create stories that drive the browser<br /></li></ul>', '2008-10-30 12:54:28')[0m

Most of the people I work with spend their time thinking about how to work with a bunch of people who are halfway around the world with only a few hours when we\'re all awake at the same time. The way we\'ve approached the problem is to take about 20% of the developers and temporarily move them to the US to work alongside us while trying to use technology to collaborate as best we can with the remaining developers (conference calls, IM, email and occasional visits of the US staff to India). We have managed to overcome some of the distance and I personally know many of the developers by all these channels and have met a large number in person (in the US and India), but problems still remain.<br /><br />I know we\'re not the only company to face these problems (in fact a recent blog by Jay Fields <a href=\"http://blog.jayfields.com/2008/09/is-distributed-development-viable.html\">Is Distributed Development Viable</a> is what got me thinking on this topic this week). I agree with most of Jay\'s post but have been wondering <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">If we solved the distributed development problem ... would the problems I see everyday disappear?</span> I have to say they wouldn\'t and when I ask myself why I\'ve concluded that our problem has less to do with the geographic distribution issues we face (which are certainly formidable!!) and more to do with the basic fact that most of our developers work for a different company than we do. I think <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">outsourcing seems to be as big if not a bigger problem than offshoring</span>. <br /><br />What do I mean by that...In my experience successfully developing software is largely dependent on having a team of good people who know each other, have worked together before and are comfortable using their critical thinking and expressing their opinions. I imagine that we decided the rate differential wasn\'t important and flew the entire India based development team to the US to sit next to us tomorrow. The problem we would still have is that the members of my development team would still work for a different company than I do. My company spends a lot of time helping its employees think about their professional development and how to advance their careers. For our developers at our outsourced partner we do none of that (one of the advantages outsourcing is supposed to grant us the advantage of a bigger pool of resources to use but I believe that we don\'t need \"resources\" we need \"developers\" - sorry to dive into my liberal arts education and deconstructionism a little bit :) With outsourcing we give up on thinking of our developers as individuals and spending time and energy (and money) on their professional development and ensuring that they are challenged and want to continue working with us. The effect is that the average tenure of most of these developers is measured in months instead of years. The problem cuts both ways as the developers have an institutional loyalty to their employer and know they will likely not be working with us for the long term so its very hard for many of them to assume the role of trusted team member who makes decisions for the long term.<br /><br />What\'s the solution... I don\'t know. All I know is that the current situation is very difficult and only focusing on shrinking the geographical distance between the US and India does not seem likely to work.<br /><br />If you made it hear thanks for reading, I needed to get this off my chest. I hope to get back to more technical topics with my next post!', '2008-10-30 12:54:28')[0m

Of course the example here is simple and the real system has additional features and complexity that I didn\'t show here. Some of these are<br /><ul><li>The import into a 2-step operation where we first ask the user to click \'Validate\' then return a table showing the data as we parsed it. This allows the user to review and verify it was parsed correctly (i.e. the columns were in the correct order). Only on this second page do we provide an \'import\' button that actually persists the new data.</li><li>The data can not only create new people but also update existing ones. The example above with just first and last name is contrived so this wouldn\'t make sense but imagine an example where there are many other columns like address, phone number, etc. Our model code is a bit more complex in that it first tries to find a person with the same first and last names. If it succeeds it will then update that person and only creates a new one if there is no match.</li><li>Some of the additional columns in the real system refer to other models in our system. To deal with these our model code must find other kinds of model objects and pass those into the <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">Person.new</span>. Ensuring the proper errors are sent back to the user in this case is fairly tricky as they may not always show up as part of the ActiveRecord validations.<br /></li></ul><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Downloading data from our app into Excel</span><br />Moving data in this direction was even easier as we just relied on the fact that Excel will open csv files as long as our Rails app returns an Excel MIME type.

Since this class was not designed for testability we often run into code that cannot be tested as is. Most often this involves code that assumes it will always be run inside our J2EE Application Server because it depends on classes provided by the server.<br /><br />I was recently working with someone on this Java class<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\"> class Person {<br /> static {<br /> Logger logger = new ContainerLogger();<br /> }<br /><br /> public String doSomething() {<br /> ...<br /> logger.info(\"I did something\");<br /> ...<br /> }<br />}<br /></blockquote>We couldn\'t create a unit test for the doSomething method because the ContainerLogger class was provided by our application server and couldn\'t be used outside the container. We refactored to come up with this solution.<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\">class MyClass {<br /> public static Logger _logger;<br /> public Logger logger() {<br /> if (_logger == null) {<br /> logger = new ContainerLogger(); <br /> }<br /> return _logger;<br /> }<br /><br /> public String doSomething() {<br /> ...<br /> logger().info(\"I did something\");<br /> ...<br /> }<br />}<br /></blockquote>We refactored our code to access the logger using the accessor method <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">logger()</span> then we also made the logger variable itself public at the same time. Why did we do those two seemingly contradictory things? The accessor method implements the singleton pattern preserving the semantics of the static initializer and the public access to the instance variable <span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">_logger</span> allows us to replace the implementation with a mock in our test.<br /><blockquote style=\"font-family: courier new;\">public class TestMyClass extends TestCase {<br /> public void testSomething() {<br /> MyClass._logger = new MockLogger();<br /> assert(MyClass.doSomething(), \"expected return\");<br /> }<br />}</blockquote>I\'ve seen too much legacy Java code that assumes it will always run inside a container but with testing we need to change our mindsets because when running a test we will be outside the container. All dependencies on the container (and in most applications I\'ve seen we don\'t need that many!) should be encapsulated and able to be mocked through dependency injection.

This lesson was learned in the 1990s in the context of a Windows application. What we did was quickly draw part of the screen (or a splash image) immediately then do the time consuming work in the background so that by the time the user was ready to interact with the application we\'d be ready for them.<br /><br />Recently I was reminded of this lesson on a website I\'m working on. We have a complicated report to show on the user\'s homepage. My first implementation involved generating the report in real-time when the page is loaded but this was very slooooow. Some profiling and analysis let us make it somewhat faster but not fast enough.<br /><br />I was stumped until I remembered my old lesson. If it wasn\'t possible to generate the report quickly, perhaps we could do it sometime when the user wouldn\'t mind.<br /><br />Luckily this is a Rails application and ActiveRecord Callbacks make it easy to do this. I could pregenerate the report and update a portion of it each time something is saved. Users expect a save to take some time and don\'t do it that often. Then generating the homepage becomes just a simple matter of displaying the existing rows.<br /><br />First I setup my models to call into the report generator every time they change<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class Person < ActiveRecord::Base<br /> after_destroy {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.destroyed(person)}<br /> after_create {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.created(person) }<br /> after_update {|person| ReportGenerator::Person.updated(person) }<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Then I implement the complicated (and slow) logic to pre-compute the rows in the report in a library class<br /><br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />module ReportGenerator<br /> class Executive<br /> def destroyed(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to delete from the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> def created(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to add to the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> def updated(executive)<br /> #figure out which rows to update in the report and persist with the Report model<br /> end<br /> end<br /> #Similar classes corresponding to the other models that trigger recalculations would go here<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Finally I can show the report on the homepage with some boring (and fast) Rails code<br /><br />Model:<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class Report < ActiveRecord::Base<br />end<br /></span></pre><br /><br />Controller:<br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br />class ReportsController < ApplicationController<br /> @report =\" ReportRows.find_by_user(current_user)\"><br /></span></pre><br /><br />and the View:<br /><br /><pre><span style=\"font-family:courier new;\"><br /><% for row in @report %><br /> Display the row<br /><% end %><br /></span></pre><br /><br />The interesting insight for me is that when optimizing there are sometimes hard problems that can\'t be solved. Its important not to lose sight of the goal you\'re aiming at (a satisfying user experience) and that sometimes involves spending the computational time somewhere where the user won\'t mind.', '2008-10-30 12:54:28')[0m

One does not visit; one pays homage, or, at the very list, makes a pilgrimage. Its chef, Dan Barber, is <a href=\"http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/06/blue-hill-at-stone-barns-pocantico-hills-new-york-dan-barber-working-farm.html\">justifiably famous</a> for his pioneering role in the evolution of <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/food/2006/09/the_haute_barnyard_hall_of_fam.html\">haute barnyard cuisine</a>, and the food at the restaurant is truly delicious. I first visited last December, and, due to a Christmas season traffic jam, my group arrived too late to take our planned jaunt around the farm. So when Lisa and I were looking for something to do last Saturday afternoon, we decided to get in her car and head across the Tappan Zee to the Stone Barns Center in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrytown,_New_York\">Tarrytown</a>.<br /><br />Stone Barns sits on the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_State_Park_Preserve\">Rockefeller estate</a> in the Pocantico Hills section of town. The buildings themselves date from the 1930\'s, and were first part of a dairy farm, and later the location of Peggy Rockefeller\'s cattle ranch. In 2004, the Rockefellers invited Dan Barber to open a for-profit restaurant as part of the larger not-for-profit agricultural and educational experiment - a center for learning about environmentally responsible, four-season farming with a restaurant to match.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SP4rpNKXFBI/AAAAAAAAFb8/zC4lCwmLraU/s1600-h/P1020632.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SP4rpNKXFBI/AAAAAAAAFb8/zC4lCwmLraU/s400/P1020632.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259689401723065362\" border=\"0\" /></a>It\'s easy to see why the experiment took root so quickly and so deeply. The property itself is stunning - all gentle slopes and rolling hills, with the stately barns rising out of a hollow in the valley. Walking around the pastures and the vegetable fields, you run into all sorts - parents pushing strollers, locals out for a morning jog, and foodies paying homage. In addition to the restaurant, there\'s a casual cafe open daily that serves strong, hot coffee (a must for keeping warm on long, blustery walks around the farm), sandwiches, salads and pastries. Almost all of the food on offer is grown or raised on the property, which means the menus are exclusively seasonal and change daily.<br /><br />Lisa and I arrived around 1 o\'clock, and started our visit with a quick trip to the gift shop. I know, I know - but, this is a truly excellent shop. I picked up a couple of $6 grocery tote bags - perfect stocking stuffers - and a fantastic (and challenging) trivia game called <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Foodie-Fight-Trivia-Game/Joyce-Lock/e/9780811858649/?itm=1\">Foodie Fight</a>. I also spied a truly gorgeous cookbook called <a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Country-Cooking-of-France/Anne-Willan/e/9780811846462/?itm=1\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Country Cooking of France</span></a>, which is going on my Christmas list.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0HIFaEDI/AAAAAAAAFc8/4nlFtJ9j0gQ/s1600-h/P1020602.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0HIFaEDI/AAAAAAAAFc8/4nlFtJ9j0gQ/s400/P1020602.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528299197829170\" border=\"0\" /></a>Since it was lunchtime, and since we needed fortification for our planned walk, we decided to have lunch next. The line snakes around the tiny cafe in a circle, which gave us ample opportunity to scope out all that was on offer. I grabbed a jar of cucumber pickles from the shelf, and thought seriously about the cow-printed tea towels and teeny coffee cakes. Also available: the decidedly not local but truly delicious <a href=\"http://www.ranchogordo.com/\">Rancho Gordo</a> heirloom beans.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQSu0KaG16I/AAAAAAAAFcs/LCDCeEDho14/s1600-h/collage.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 250px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQSu0KaG16I/AAAAAAAAFcs/LCDCeEDho14/s400/collage.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261522475845867426\" border=\"0\" /></a>We finally made it up to the counter, where we ordered the bologna sandwich with pickles, zucchini fritatta, caramel apple, apple custard tart, and two big, steaming cups of coffee. We camped out at a picnic table outside and wolfed down our feast.<br /><br />The homemade bologna was the best bologna I have ever tasted - light in texture, tangy and meaty in flavor, and layered on a fluffy piece of focaccia spread with strong mustard. The apple tart was a bit too sweet, but the cookie crumble crust on the bottom was salty enough to cut the sugar. The caramel apple, served on a twig, was deliciously smoky, if tooth-crackingly tough to bite into. All in all, a good lunch.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0MQtv_2I/AAAAAAAAFdE/3Fd4aV47APU/s1600-h/P1020609.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0MQtv_2I/AAAAAAAAFdE/3Fd4aV47APU/s400/P1020609.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528387413868386\" border=\"0\" /></a>Finally, filled with lunchtime goodness, we set off on a walk around the property. We walked past the private dining room, where the staff were setting up for a wedding, arranging flowers and building a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuppah\">chuppah</a> out of twigs and berries from the farm and surrounding park. We saw a fallow vegetable field, walked past the dairy cows relaxing in their pasture, and paid a visit to the chickens, who gathered around our feet, pecking gently at our toes in search of a snack.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0Cu7scQI/AAAAAAAAFc0/5qQvUqYqApA/s1600-h/P1020641.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0Cu7scQI/AAAAAAAAFc0/5qQvUqYqApA/s400/P1020641.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528223726727426\" border=\"0\" /></a>Just past the chickens were a flock of pure-white ducks and a few gigantic pigs. These guys had to be at least three hundred pounds each. As we approached, I remembered the bologna sandwich and started feeling a bit, well, guilty. But then I realized how happy the pigs were, rooting around in their trough, enjoying the sunshine, wandering at will, and realized it was not only the best-tasting bologna I\'d ever eaten - it was also probably the most ethically sound.<br /><br />All in all, that was the prevailing lesson of the day. Seeing where your food comes from, spending time with it, smelling the earth out of which it grew, picking your way across the field where it was raised - it makes you that much more appreciative of it, and far more aware of the impact your choices have. The peace of mind you gain by understanding how your food was produced cannot be overstated. Yes, it can be expensive and a bit of a hassle to eat locally and humanely, but if you can afford the little bit of extra money and a little bit more extra time, it truly is worth it.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0TG6kEaI/AAAAAAAAFdM/5I4saT6Rm5U/s1600-h/P1020649.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SQS0TG6kEaI/AAAAAAAAFdM/5I4saT6Rm5U/s400/P1020649.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261528505042342306\" border=\"0\" /></a>', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

But, no - when nothing else appeals, when nothing else will do, cucumbers are where it\'s at for me.<br /><br />And lest you think that I\'m some sort of johnny-come-lately where cucumbers are concerned, let me tell you a little story. When I was in elementary school, my parents had to visit the school each year for the obligatory Parents\' Night. One year (maybe my mom will chime in on the comments and tell us which), the teacher had each of the parents guess which desk belonged to their child my reading the children\'s answers to a set of questions. One of the questions was, \"What\'s your favorite food?\" The other kids mainly answered \"pizza,\" or \"spaghetti\" or \"steak\" - but my answer was \"cucumbers.\"<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SPvZyBHNJ4I/AAAAAAAAFbU/-O50V1rSxnU/s1600-h/IMG_0417.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SPvZyBHNJ4I/AAAAAAAAFbU/-O50V1rSxnU/s400/IMG_0417.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259036443200530306\" border=\"0\" /></a>To this day, I go through about two pounds of cucumbers each week - I slice them into sticks and snack on them on weekend afternoons, I chop them into salads almost every night with dinner, and sometimes I even cook with them. They\'re great in stir-fries, where they add a bit of freshness and crunch; seeded and finely chopped, they add texture and contrast to chicken and tuna salad; and, thinly sliced and lightly sauteed in a bit of butter, salt and pepper, they become a luscious side dish all their own.<br /><br />I love cucumbers in all their incarnations - Kirby, Persian, English, standard - no matter which, the savory melon-like flavor keeps me coming back again and again. I suspect I\'ll never tire of cucumbers - I\'ll probably still be picking them out of salad bowls right up until the end of time.', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

It\'s all very Beckettian, but I digress. The important part: I worked from home, which normally means ordering lunch in to save time and avoid being away from the laptop for too long. However, given the financial situation these days, I\'ve been shamed into being a bit more frugal. So, ordering in is out, cooking in is, well, in.<br /><br />I decided to roast a chicken leg alongside the season\'s first batch of brussels sprouts (Yay!). Given this was a celebratory occasion - brussels sprouts being quite possibly my favorite winter vegetable - bacon seemed in order, too. And, since it would be about five minutes\' prep work, it fit into my agenda - being continuously available when not in the office so as not to look like a slacker.<br /><br />Cleaning and trimming the sprouts is pretty quick work. My method is to trim the root off the bottom, which brings most of the outer leaves with it, leaving very little for you to actually peel back. The fresh sprouts smell a bit like raw broccoli - crisply peppery and generally green. I would be lying if I said I don\'t occasionally nibble on the root trimmings, which squeak and snap between your teeth.<br /><br />Once roasted or sauteed, though, the sprouts are tender and nutty, and slightly stinky - just like broccoli. (And, just like broccoli, they\'re terrible when overcooked or boiled beyond recognition - please don\'t commit this crime against food-manity.) If you like your sprouts well-done, the charred bits are nice and chewy. They go well with anything, in my opinion, but shine brightest when paired with a bit of animal fat, either bacon or schmaltz, and dressed with some balsamic vinegar and a bit of parmesan cheese.<br /><br />I nestled the chicken leg in the pile of prepped sprouts, sprinkled the lot with olive oil, salt and pepper, and tucked the pan into the oven to roast for about half an hour while I went back to being a responsible employee. My reward: the best lunch I\'d had all week, consumed in my pajamas.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic Vinegar and Bacon<br /><br /></span>1 1/2 tbs. olive oil, divided<br />2 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2 inch lardons<br />1/2 pound brussels sprouts, cleaned, trimmed and sliced in half lengthwise<br />1 tbs. good balsamic vinegar<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Pre-heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />In a medium skillet, heat 1/2 tbs. of the olive oil over high heat until hot. Reduce heat to medium and add the bacon to the skillet. Saute until the fat rendered and the bacon is slightly crisped. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and reserve. Pour all but 1 tsp. of the bacon fat from the pan.<br /><br />Add the sprouts to the pan and toss in the remaining bacon fat and the remaining tablespoon of oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and place the skillet in the oven. Roast sprouts to desired level of done-ness, about 25 to 30 minutes for me. Remove skillet from the oven and toss the sprouts with the reserved bacon and the balsamic vinegar. Adjust seasonings and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves 2.</span>', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

Corn, Pollan revealed, is the backbone of our industrial food complex, and is the primary ingredient in many, many more foods than you had ever imagined. It represents the most evil elements of our mechanization of the food chain, and it\'s just bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Of course, Pollan does not think we should stop eating corn in its purer forms - right off the cob, for instance. He\'s far more reasonable than that. But for months after I read the book, I was terrified of buying and eating corn, panicking that I was feeding into a system I had no interest in supporting. Then I realized that I still eat Cheetos (king of hyper-processed corn and erstaz cheese) when I\'m hungover, and decided it was time to buy and eat some sweet corn, particularly since it happens to be in season.<br /><br />When I approached the Migliorelli stand at the Union Square Greenmarket, I noticed they\'d posted a sign: \"No husking.\" Really? I was always taught to husk an ear of corn, just barely, to double-check that the cob was, in fact, intact and free of blemishes. First, you check that it\'s heavy for its size (indicating juiciness), then you pull back the husk just a tad. Rule-follower though I typically I am, I rebelled and husked my ears, rejecting only one out of six (it had no kernels on the top inch of the cob - not a good sign).<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SM6zYumZgJI/AAAAAAAAD8A/T8mAhhl1llQ/s1600-h/IMG_0443.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SM6zYumZgJI/AAAAAAAAD8A/T8mAhhl1llQ/s400/IMG_0443.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246327853340524690\" border=\"0\" /></a>I brought the corn home and, once all the groceries were put away, the time came to cook it. One problem: I had never shucked corn inside. Ever. Growing up in Connecticut, land of patios and porches, corn shucking was an outdoor ritual. It seems wrong to shuck corn anywhere but the the back steps, holding the cob over a paper grocery bag big enough to catch all the silk. I stood at my tiny counter for a minute, seriously contemplated climbing out onto the fire escape, and then decided to just give indoor shucking a shot. Let\'s just say there was a fair bit of clean up involved, despite my best efforts to aim for the bag.<br /><br />Next, I brought a pot of (unsalted - salt makes the corn tough) water to boil and added the freshly shucked cobs to it, removing them a few moments later when they had begun to smell of - you guessed it - corn. Unscientific, I know, but it works. I cooked five ears - clearly too many to eat in one sitting. I set four ears aside to cool and use later in the week.<br /><br />The fifth I rubbed with butter, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and ate, standing up, in my kitchen. The butter ran down my chin, the corn got stuck in my teeth (This, I remembered, was why my grandfather always cut his off the cob.), and I generally made a mess of myself.<br /><br />It was lovely.', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

Maybe it\'s that they\'re a root, or maybe it\'s that they (sometimes) come in that Christmas-y red color (and also in candy cane-esque red and white stripes). Either way, I was pleasantly surprised a couple of years ago when I realized that they are, in fact, part of summer\'s ridiculous bounty (and are in season all the way through October).<br /><br />Pleased because they go so well with another of summer\'s denizens, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_beans\">green beans</a>. For some reason, the sharp, slightly peppery flavor of the beans plays gorgeously against the sweet, earthy beets, resulting in some of the best salads of the season - particularly when you throw some sherry vinegar, greek yogurt and fresh dill into the mix.<br /><br />Last weekend, looking for a way to use up the second half of the Knoll Crest pasta I bought, I decided to turn one of my favorite summer salads into a pretty summer pasta - egg fettucine with roasted beets, green beans, dill and yogurt.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SLGLou14c5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/oubgh2YrXTE/s1600-h/IMG_0476.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SLGLou14c5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/oubgh2YrXTE/s400/IMG_0476.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238121373493654418\" border=\"0\" /></a>I started off by roasting the beets, which is a pretty simple task. You wash them, trim the ends off, drizzle them with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast them in a foil packet for about 45 minutes. Once they\'re cool, peeling them is a cinch - just start yourself off with a small paring knife, and rub the skins off with your fingers. Yes, you\'ll get beet juice all over your hands, but, don\'t worry - it washes off.<br /><br />You can marinate the beets overnight in a little oil and lemon juice, or you can use them right away. Either way, they\'re delicious. The beans just need a quick <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching\">blanching</a> in salted water - this will par-cook them and also make sure they are at their brightest green color.<br /><br />And, if you\'re going low-carb these days, just leave the pasta out - this makes an excellent warm salad, too.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fettucine with Beets and Beans</span><br /><br />1/2 lb. assorted fresh beets<br />1/2 lb. fresh green beans<br />Olive oil<br />1/2 red onion, finely minced<br />1 tbs. sherry vinegar<br />1/4 cup chopped dill<br />1/2 lb. fresh fettucine<br />1/3 cup plain yogurt<br />Salt and pepper, to taste<br /><br />Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Clean and trim the beets. Spread a piece of foil on a cookie sheet, place beets on the foil, and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Fold the foil to form a packet, and place the packet (on the cookie sheet) in the oven. Roast for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the beets are tender when poked with a fork. Remove pack from oven and set aside to cool.<br /><br />Once beets are cool, peel them and cut into 1-inch cubes. Set aside. Meanwhile, trim the beans and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching\">blanch them</a> in a pot of boiling, salted water. Cut each bean in half (on an angle, if you\'re feeling fancy) and set aside.<br /><br />Bring the water to boil again (yes, you can use the same water, just add a little extra salt), and cook the pasta while you make the sauce.<br /><br />Add about 1 tbs. of olive oil to a medium skillet set over medium heat, and cook the onion until fragrant and softened, about two minutes. Add the sherry vinegar and cook down until it has become a bit thick and syrupy. Add the beans and beets to the pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until warmed through and coated with the vinegar and onion. Add all but a couple pinches of the dill and cook for another minute or so.<br /><br />Add the cooked pasta to the pan, toss everything together, and transfer to bowls to serve. Top the pasta with the yogurt, dividing between the two bowls. Do the same with remaining dill, adjust seasonings to taste, and dig in!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves two.</span>', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

A classic example is the group of women who run the Knoll Crest poultry stand, by far the market\'s most popular destination for eggs and chicken. They know most of their customers by looks, and some by name. They know that I always want a chicken, that 3 pounds is my ideal chicken size, and that I buy a dozen large brown eggs every other week or so.<br /><br />They also know that, every now and again, I\'ll give in to temptation and pick up a container of their remarkably fresh egg fettuccine.<br /><br />I did just that this past Saturday, reasoning that the tomatoes I\'d bought a few stands over deserved a gorgeous bed upon which to recline. Or some such thing. Basically, I really wanted pasta with a quick tomato sauce for lunch.<br /><br />When I got home, I washed my tomatoes, picked some <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2008/08/getting-my-hands-dirty.html\">basil from my windowsill plant</a>, and sliced a couple of cloves of garlic. A little olive oil went into the skillet, then the garlic and red pepper flakes, then the tomatoes and basil.<br /><br />While that cooked for a minute or two (just to warm the tomatoes through and get the basil working), I quickly cooked the pasta in boiling, salted water - since it was fresh, it took about 90 seconds to cook completely through to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente\">al dente</a>. I added the fettuccine to the skillet, whooshed everything around for a few minutes, tasted for seasoning (tomatoes like a good amount of salt, in my opinion), and spooned it out.<br /><br />The pasta was great - toothsome and flavorful, and the sauce was just what I wanted - simple and honest, just tomatoes, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper. My lunches are rarely so satisfying - so, thank you, Knoll Crest Farm, for being so darn friendly, and for making such fricking awesome pasta.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saturday Lunch Pasta<br /></span><br />2 tsps. olive oil<br />2 cloves garlic, sliced (thinly) crosswise<br />1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes<br />1/2 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise<br />4-5 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced crosswise<br />1/4 lb. fresh egg pasta, such as fettuccine or linguine<br />Salt, to taste<br /><br />Add the olive oil to a medium skillet set over medium heat, and, once it is warm, add the garlic to the pan. Sauté until fragrant and softened, about one minute, then add the red pepper flakes, tomatoes, and a pinch of salt. Sauté for a minute or two, stirring constantly, then add 2/3 of the sliced basil, stirring to distribute throughout the sauce.<br /><br />Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pot of boiling, salted water until al dente (about 1-2 minutes for fresh pasta). Drain and add the pasta to the skillet, stirring to distribute the sauce evenly throughout the pasta. Allow to cook in the skillet for a minute, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking - this will flavor the pasta more deeply - then transfer to a bowl.<br /><br />Adjust seasonings, top with remaining basil, and eat!<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serves one; multiplies easily to serve many.</span><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span></span>', '2008-10-30 12:54:30')[0m

But, in my humble opinion, chicken is never so good as when it is trussed, rubbed all over with some sort of fat (olive oil, butter, and schmaltz are best), showered with salt and pepper, and roasted in a hot, dry oven. I believe this to be, at the risk of hubris, the absolute best way of cooking chicken. Ever.<br /><br />If you\'re feeling fancy, you can make a pan sauce out of the drippings. Also good - using some of those drippings in the vinaigrette for the salad or vegetables you serve alongside. And please save the carcass and use it for stock - it will be the best and cheapest stock you\'ve ever made, and it will mean using every last bit of that wonderful chicken that gave its life for your supper.

Some say its roots lie in the deadened taste buds of modern America, some say it\'s just the result of excellent advertising on the part of TBWA (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolut_Vodka\">on behalf of Absolut</a>, of course). According to those theories, Americans are either without taste or just plain malleable.<br /><br />Either way, I blame the vodka craze for the fact that I didn\'t even taste <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin\">gin</a> until my mid-20\'s. My mother never had it in the house, and I grew up viewing it as the drink of degenerate, 19th century Englishmen and -women.<br /><br />For shame, truly, because gin is AWESOME. There is no better word to describe the fantastic concoction of alcohol and herbs that is a quality gin. Right now, I\'m enjoying a gin martini (which, by definition, requires vermouth, and if you don\'t think so, you\'re wrong) - 3 ounces of <a href=\"http://plymouthgin.com/\">Plymouth</a>, a tablespoon on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noilly_Prat\">Noilly dry</a>, stirred vigorously with ice, and garnished with some lemon zest (I don\'t really like olives.). And it\'s fabulous - complex, herby, smooth, delicious.<br /><br />So please, please - next time you\'re out, stop yourself from ordering that vodka soda and go for a gin and tonic instead (assuming the place has decent gin - most places at least have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanqueray\">Tanqueray</a>, which makes a good G&amp;T).

In the last couple of years, though, I\'ve finally realized how nice it is to have fresh herbs around when you need them, and, even more than that, how much life and verve plants bring into a home.<br /><br />My friend Nick gave me a Meyer lemon tree for Christmas, and <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2008/04/update-not-dead-yet.html\">my success at keeping it alive</a> for more than six months gave me the confidence to go out and find some more green things for the windowsill. So, yesterday morning, armed with $15 and a dream, I went down to the Union Square Greenmarket and bought two basil plants, a thyme plant, and a little sage bush.<br /><br />I brought them home (carefully, on the subway) and transplanted them into the <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70075921\">Ikea pots</a> I had waiting. The whole process took about 20 minutes (though I did make a bit of a mess), and now I have a gorgeous-smelling assortment of plants.

(Not all the time, though - a girl needs to leave room for her Diet Coke and her booze.)<br /><br />My coffeemaker of choice is a <a href=\"http://www.bodumusa.com/shop/line.asp?MD=1&amp;GID=3&amp;LID=10&amp;CHK=&amp;SLT=&amp;mscssid=E1QDST3SWC738NSAGC467PWFBUJL25GA\">Bodum Chambord French press</a> - I love it for the counter space it saves and also for the rich, hearty brew it produces. But one thing it doesn\'t do is make espresso.<br /><br />To date, I haven\'t invested in an espresso maker - it seems like an awful lot of money for something that would probably be used two times a week, maximum. Plus, it would take up precious counter space in my tiny kitchen. But, if I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">could </span>buy any espresso maker on earth, I think it would have to be this powder-blue FrancisFrancis! model. It\'s gorgeous, it\'s hard-working, and it\'s long-lasting. What more could a girl want?<br /><br />But, alas, at almost $900, it\'s way out of reach.

Sure, we city-dwellers enjoy our fair portion of shared brunches, and more than our allotment of shared dinners, but we rarely see our friends spreading jam on toast while still wearing their footsie pajamas.<br /><br />Maybe it\'s because I live alone, but, to me, eating breakfast with friends is a real treat, a true novelty, and something I really look forward to when traveling. And it doesn\'t have to be a fancy pancake breakfast, either (though those are fun, too) - sometimes the best breakfast is just coffee and a brioche smeared with butter and jam.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI87GPHVVfI/AAAAAAAAD2s/8mak--Rm-iw/s1600-h/IMG_0372.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI87GPHVVfI/AAAAAAAAD2s/8mak--Rm-iw/s400/IMG_0372.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228462670722979314\" border=\"0\" /></a>Louisa and I made <a href=\"http://queenietakesmanhattan.blogspot.com/2007/09/let-us-eat-brioche.html\">our first loaves of brioche together last summer</a>, and during my visit this year we decided we couldn\'t let the opportunity to create a true tradition pass us by. This time, though, we decided to make one full loaf and six small, traditional brioches, the better to snack and breakfast on.<br /><br />The little guys were just as easy to make as the big one - we followed the same recipe as last time and used half the dough to fill Louisa\'s silicon brioche pan (with a cookie sheet underneath to lend stability to the flexible material) and half for the loaf. You could also use the <a href=\"http://www.surlatable.com/product/tinned+steel+brioche+molds.do?search=basic&amp;keyword=brioche&amp;sortby=gsa&amp;asc=true&amp;page=1\">more traditional brioche molds</a> - again, just stick them on a cookie sheet to make the whole thing easier. We topped the individual brioches with the same egg wash used on the loaf, and added some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovado\">muscovado sugar</a> for added crunch (and to make things all pretty-like).<br /><br />The result? A loaf for French bread and sandwich-making, and six perfect breakfast treats, perfect for enjoying with friends and a big pot of coffee.', '2008-10-30 12:54:31')[0m

Which of course means that I\'m desperate to entertain as many friends as possible, the better to experiment with copious amounts of produce and seafood.<br /><br />The only problem? It\'s really freakin\' hot out, and that makes having people over a bit more complicated. Sure, I have a great AC stuck through one of my two windows, but it doesn\'t do a whole lot when the oven and stove are going full blast and there are five extra people in here.<br /><br />So, what\'s a girl to do? Moving is not an option, nor is the complete absence of cooking. Not for me, anyway. So I spend my summers searching high and low for meals that can be made in advance, served mostly at room temperature, and showcase all the delicious things in season right now. Because, really, most of this stuff is better left as pristine as possible. I mean, there\'s nothing better than popping a single, tart blueberry in your mouth, or stealing a ripe, earthy tomato from the bowl and eating it plain.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, this meant starting with a <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/SUMMER-CORN-SOUP-242979\">gorgeous corn soup</a> courtesy of Dorie Greenspan, and following that up with a <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/grilled-tuna-nicoise-platter-recipe/index.html\">giant salad niçoise</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/MASCARPONE-FILLED-CAKE-WITH-SHERRIED-BERRIES-242873\">buttermilk cake with mascarpone and berries</a>. As far as no-cook meals go, this was on the more-cooking-than-not end of the scale. The soup was made ahead but had to be re-heated, the salad took lots of prep work, even though it was all super-easy, the tuna had to be seared just before eating, and the cake couldn\'t be assembled ahead of time.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI0wVH5mBhI/AAAAAAAADyI/JklETbNu1Fw/s1600-h/IMG_0418.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://bp1.blogger.com/_VWsqiRWFCwc/SI0wVH5mBhI/AAAAAAAADyI/JklETbNu1Fw/s400/IMG_0418.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5227887881903015442\" border=\"0\" /></a>Last night, though, I served what I think might just be the perfect summertime dinner party meal. We started things off with <a href=\"http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/special/2003/aquavit/gravlax.html\">homemade gravlax</a> - which meant, literally, zero cooking. You just cure the raw salmon in a salt/sugar/pepper/dill mixture, then serve it with a coffee and mustard flavored sauce.<br /><br />Next up, <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/gazpacho-recipe/index.html\">Ina Garten\'s superlative gazpacho</a>. A lot of chopping, but, again, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">no</span> cooking. (And, as gazpacho goes, remarkably deep in flavor and perfectly imperfect in texture.)

My cravings tend to run in the salty/greasy direction (bad Chinese, fried chicken, <a href=\"http://www.robscape.com/files/prod-pirate-booty.php\">Pirate\'s Booty</a>), but, every so often, a need for cake worms its way in.<br /><br />Last Sunday, just such a craving hit me like a sack of bricks, and I decided to assuage said sack with a marble cupcake from <a href=\"http://www.twolittleredhens.com/\">Two Little Red Hens</a>. Conveniently located about half a block from my Yorkville apartment, it\'s an adorable bakery specializing in traditional American treats. They have ridiculously good <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?s=5b1a22bd1dc825e5893f0bd2beb02554&amp;showtopic=83368&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1134823\">maple scones</a>, beautiful cakes, and witty frosted cookies (featured on Sunday: hot dogs and watermelon slices). They also make a mean iced coffee.<br /><br />The marble cupcake was good - especially the cake part, which was white sponge swirled with chocolate. The buttercream was tasty, but a bit too cold from the fridge. It just didn\'t give enough, and as a result broke off in little pieces. It was a bit like eating (really, really) buttery fudge. That said, it did hit the spot.<br /><br />So, is it bad that this was my dinner on Sunday night?', '2008-10-30 12:54:31')[0m

Better than all the jazzy so-called locks that some companies try and push onto unsuspecting customers.</p>\n\n\n	<p>Locking your bike does not guarantee 100% security, its just to make it harder to foil a theft.</p>\n\n\n	<p>Some simple thumb rules can preventing some heart ache</p>\n\n\n	<ul>\n	<li>Always <span class=\'caps\'>ALWAYS</span> lock your bike. Be Paranoid.</li>\n		<li>Always make sure the frame and the wheels are locked like shown below.</li>\n		<li>Always lock the bike to something stationary. Check the stationary object, it might not be as strong as you think.</li>\n		<li>Remove movable parts – cyclo-computers, expensive saddle bags and lights can easily be slipped off and carried with you.</li>\n		<li>Its amazing how many folks have lost their bikes at home. Always lock your bike, even at home</li>\n		<li>Don’t keep the bike locked in dark dingy places. Makes it much easier for thieves to work on the lock and steal the bike. Lock the bike in a fairly visible place.</li>\n		<li>Try and change the place you lock the bike everyday.</li>\n		<li>Keep your Name and contact info on the bike – inside the seat post for example. If you lose your bike, it becomes much easier to prove that its yours.</li>\n	</ul>\n\n\n	<p>Bike theft is still not a huge problem in India like some of the Western countries for example. Kryptonite, which manufactures some fantastic locks, has named quite a few of <a href=\'http://www.kryptonitelock.com/Products/List.aspx?cid=1000&amp;#38;scid=1002\'>its Chain locks</a> after New York, a city which is paranoid about locking its bikes.</p>\n\n\n	<p><a href=\'http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohan_kini/sets/72157606883533837/\'><img src=\'http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/2786402738_cae543dfb9_o.png\' alt=\'\' /></a></p>\n\n\n	<p>[Update] Gautam had made a very sensible comment on this post asking for more India specific info. Where do folks lock their bikes in India ?</p>\n\n\n	<p>At the moment we dont have many bicycle parking in the country so it basically boils down to finding a strong stationary object like a lamp post or railing and securing your bicycle using a lock. At work I lock up my bike to a huge generator. <br> \nAs long as you are not causing anyone any inconvenience it should be ok to secure your bike to some public property/item.</p>\n\n\n	<p>We do have groups in the country who are lobbying for bike amenities to get stuff like this to make life easier. \n<br>Interested ? join us.</p>\n\n\n&lt;noscript> <a href=\'http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/872527/\'>How good is the post “Bike Security 101”</a> <br /> <span> (<a href=\'http://www.polldaddy.com\'> polls</a>)</span>&lt;/noscript>\n ', '2008-10-30 12:54:31')[0m

(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_2005\">source</a>)<br />But in terms of the GDP per capita, India(122nd place) is way behind Singapore(22nd place) (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">source</a>)<br />Tourism is one of the largest industries of Singapore, with about 9 million tourists in 2005.<br /><br />Singapore has a rich mixture of different cultures as it is mainly formed out of immigrants from Malay, Chinese, Indian, British among other places. From what I observed, the identity of singapore as a country has evolved as an amalgam of the different immigrants who have settled there.<br /><br />The importance given to small details which may seem insignificant to us Indians, hit me right on the face. Be it the roads, or the cleanliness, or the infrastructure effort that has gone into the architecture and planning, especially with respect to the tourists, it is commendable.<br />The blend of art and technology is visible everywhere. Its indeed very difficult to get lost out there, with all the indicators and helpful people. The creativity with which the places are built makes it a pleasure for tourists to spend time.<br /><br />Well, they do have their own set of problems, which I wont go into now, but on the whole, it is a beautiful country.My visit made me learn a lot about India too, along with, needless to say, Singapore.<br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3097/1236/1600/SUC50003.0.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3097/1236/400/SUC50003.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />I am not trying to compare two nations and rate them or anything of that sort. The few days that I have seen in singapore is very trivial to make any such comparison. And also, as obvious from the facts, the scale at which these countries operate is totally different.<br /><br />It was definitely a good decision to visit Singapore. Thanks to my sister who pushed for it the most, we decided to go in the last moment. I\'ll upload a few snaps when I get some time.<br /><br />Majulah Singapura!!

Some were of the opinion that it was horrible and i should get it cut as soon as possible, but there was a minority of them who showed quite positive reactions to it :-). Some asked me if I had taken a vow or an oath that till I do something I wouldn\'t get it cut and some others teased me saying that my girlfriend had probably ditched me and i had lost interest in life. I was being compared to all sorts of people ranging from musicians to saints to film actors to mythological characters and what not! There were <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">very very</span> few people who were totally indifferent to this and went on as normal.<br /><br />Nevertheless, i continued growing my hair till I felt like doing it. Honestly, there was no other reason at all. And there need not be.<br /><br />After about 6 months, one fine day I just went and got my haircut done and was back to my normal looks.<br />Now again all the reactions(fun ;-)) started. People who had liked my long hair started scolding me as to why I did this and lost my individuality! And others phewed sighs of relief and said that they could atleast see me now.<br />Again mixed reactions!<br />Anyway, my experiment ended here and I am \"back to normal?\"!

What is universally agreed is that any \"random number generator\" based solely on deterministic computation cannot be regarded as a \"true\" random number generator, since its output is inherently predictable. John von Neumann once famously said \"Anyone who uses arithmetic methods to produce random numbers is in a state of sin\", thus neatly summarizing the situation.<br />- Wikipedia (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator\">Random number Generator</a>)<br /><br />For eg., if you use a single random number generation algorithm and initialize it with the same seed twice, it generates the same sequence of random(??) numbers.<br />Yes, there are <a href=\"http://lavarnd.com/\">random number generators</a> which use chaotic sources to generate \"high quality\" random numbers. But in the end, all they seem to use is the inherent randomness in the universe to generate random numbers.<br /><br />This is in fact pointing to something quite fundamental.<br />Is there anything thats actually random in this universe?<br />Look at this now:<br />What exactly is chaos? The name \"chaos theory\" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data (see <a href=\"http://www.imho.com/grae/chaos/chaos.html\">here</a>).<br /><br />To look at an example,<br />The flapping of a single butterfly\'s wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month\'s time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn\'t happen.

There are lots of Web automation and testing tools out there and I\'m not trying to compare. But the choice of a tool should not come in the way of development or maintaining the application. It should have minimum interference with the application but still achieve the purpose. And you should be able to extend the tool to your needs. And I think Sahi goes a long way in achieving all this. It just works like a charm.

They keep happening every now and then, for books/movies and every kind of media. What is the root cause of such fanaticism in people?<br /><br /><blockquote>\"...So in every religion you find there are the three stages: philosophy,mythology, and ceremonial. There is one advantage which can be pleaded for the Vedanta, that in India, fortunately, these three stages have been sharply defined. In other religions the principles are so interwoven with the mythology that it is very hard to distinguish one from the other. The mythology stands supreme, swallowing up the principles; and in course of centuries the principles are lost sight of. The explanation, the illustration of the principle, swallows up the principle, and the people see only the explanation, the prophet, the preacher, while the principles have gone out of existence almost - so much so that even today, if a man dares to preach the principles of Christianity apart from Christ, they will try to attack him and think he is wrong and dealing blows at Christianity. In the same way, if a man wants to preach the principles of Mohammedanism, Mohammedans will think the same; because concrete ideas, the lives of great men and prophets, have entirely overshadowed the principles.<br /><br />In Vedanta the chief advantage is that it was not the work of one single man; and therefore, naturally, unlike Buddhism, or Christianity, or Mohammedanism, the prophet or teacher did not entirely swallow up or overshadow the principles. The principles live, and the prophets, as it were, form a secondary group, unknown to Vedanta. The Upanishads speak of no particular prophet, but they speak of various prophets and prophetesses. The old Hebrews had something of that idea; yet we find Moses occupying most of the space of the Hebrew literature. Of course I do not mean that it is bad that these prophets should take religious hold of a nation; but it certainly is very injurious if the whole field of principles is lost sight of. We can very much agree as to principles, but not very much as to persons. The persons appeal to our emotions; and the principles, to something higher, to our calm judgement. Principles must conquer in the long run, for that is the manhood of man. Emotions many times drag us down to the level of animals. Emotions have more connection with the senses than with the faculty of reason; and, therefore, when principles are entirely lost sight of and emotions prevail, religions degenerate into fanaticism and sectarianism. They are no better than party politics and such things. The most horribly ignorant notions will be taken up, and for these ideas thousands will be ready to cut the throats of their brethren. This is the reason that, though these great personalities and prophets are tremendous motive powers for good, at the same time their lives are altogether dangerous when they lead to the disregard of the principles they represent. That has always led to fanaticism, and has deluged the world in blood....\"</blockquote><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Quoted from:</span> <a href=\"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/complete_works.htm\">Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda</a> Volume 6 (<a href=\"http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_6/lectures_and_discourses/the_methods_and_purpose_of_religion.htm\">The Methods and Purpose of Religion</a>)<br /></div>', '2008-10-30 12:54:33')[0m

After struggling a lot with the configurations and searching on the web I shot a mail to one of the people behind CC and quite soon, I had the answer.<br /><br />There was a simple mistake that was causing Cruise to behave randomly. The problem was that the system time on the Repository server and the time on the cruise control box was not synchronized. There was some 5-6 hour difference between the two. CruiseControl checks for modifications that have happened after a given time. So if the time is not synchronized, obviously it wouldn\'t find modifications!<br /><br />This is very important whenever CruiseControl and the Source repository are on different machines:<br />Make sure that the time/date on the cruise box is synchronized with the time/date on the repository box.<br />Btw, <a href=\"http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/Frequently+Asked+Questions\">This</a> may be helpful.', '2008-10-30 12:54:33')[0m

The way you look at the world starts slowly changing. Especially the many worlds interpretation is a very interesting one.

The detector is switched on for just long enough so that there is 50-50 chance that one of the atoms in the radioactive material will decay. If the detector does record such an event, then the glass bottle is crushed and the cat dies; if not, the cat lives.<br />We have no way of knowing the outcome of this experiment until we open the box to look inside.<br />The whole experiment is governed by the rule that the superposition of both the outcomes of this is real until we look at the experiment, and that only at that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">instant</span> of observation does the decision happen and one of the outcomes is seen.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Many worlds Interpretation</span><br />This theory says that both the outcomes of the experiment are equally real. The surprise is that according to this theory there is not one real cat but <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">two</span>. There is a live cat, and there is a dead cat; but they are located <span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">in different worlds</span>.<br />Faced with the decision, the whole world - the universe - split into two versions of itself, identical in all respects except that in one version the atom decayed and the cat died, while in the other the atom did not decay and the cat lived.<br /><br />It sounds like science fiction but it goes far deeper that any science fiction.

It took quite sometime for me to understand it completely. In fact, the meaning flashed to me today during my morning jog!<br /><br />In a programmer\'s perspective, what exactly is <font style=\"font-style: italic;\">data</font>?<br />This is a very subtle concept. Very difficult to explain.<br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Data is something that is constructed and behaves in a particular way. i.e, What data is, is determined by how it behaves.<br />How do you say this programmatically? - Data is that which is defined by constructors and procedures, together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid representation.<br /><br /></div> </div> <font style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example</font>: consider the notion of a \'pair\' in lisp. A \'pair\' is a way of glueing two pieces of data. This is how I will probably explain it:<br /><tt><br />(define z (cons x y))<br /></tt><tt>(car z) => x<br /></tt><tt>(cdr z) => y<br /><br /></tt><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">We never actually said what a pair was, only that there are procedures <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt>, and <tt>cdr</tt> for operating on pairs. But the only thing we need to know about these three operations <a name=\"%_idx_1452\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1454\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1456\"></a><a name=\"%_idx_1458\"></a>is that if we glue two objects together using <tt>cons</tt> we can retrieve the objects using <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>.<br />The interesting thing is that any triple of procedures that satisfies the above condition can be used as the basis for implementing pairs. This is one such triple:<br /></div><br /><tt>(define (cons x y)<br />(lambda (m) (m x y)))<br /><br /><a name=\"%_idx_1470\"></a>(define (car z)<br />(z (lambda (p q) p)))</tt><br /><br /><tt>(define (cdr z)<br />(z (lambda (p q) q)))</tt><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This point is illustrated strikingly by the fact that we could implement <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt>, and <tt>cdr</tt> without using any data structures at all but only using procedures. <font style=\"font-style: italic;\">This blurs the distinction between \'procedure\' and \'data\'</font>. Procedure <---> data. Data <---> procedure. Hmm...I need to think.<br /></div>', '2008-10-30 12:54:33')[0m

Today my mind is occupied with a lot of other things. This is the background:<br /><br />From the last one year I was working on a large project and somewhat hidden from most of the nitty-gritties of an organization outside the problems of actual delivery of software. From the last one month, since I rolled out of that project, I am opening my eyes to some of these things. I have a few observations to make: This is probably true for any consulting firm. </div><div align=\"justify\"><br /></div><ul><li><div align=\"justify\">The delivery phase is actually just one part of a very large process.</div></li><li><div align=\"justify\">There is a lot of effort by a lot of people that goes in before an assignment actually comes through to the delivery stage. </div></li></ul><p align=\"justify\">I was hearing one of our senior executives talk about these matters (and a lot more things). Everything was so tangled up. Each and every decision which tries to untangle some of these things, brings with it a few more knots as well. As a whole, it is a chaotic environment. If you consider all the multitudes of things that humans are trying to do in this existence, I don\'t see any sort of order in this at all. It feels as though people are trying to make sense out of nonsense. </p><p align=\"justify\">This fact leads to a more general question. Why are human beings in general creating and getting involved in all these complicated situations? What is driving humans to create problems for themselves and solve them and get stuck in this never ending chain?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Money</u> </strong>- This is probably the answer for a vast majority but we see that beyond a certain level, it hardly matters. People sometimes take risks and are ready to lose money for <em>something else</em>.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Ego</u> </strong>- This is probably one factor which overtakes money. People can go to any extent to maintain their self image. Probably this is also one of the factors driving the free software movement. But I feel this is again not the end. There is <em>something else</em>.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><u>Something Else</u> </strong>- I dont know what to call it. It involves the high level of <strong>passion </strong>exhibited by humans in whatever they are interested in. It is the infinite amount of <strong>creativity</strong> hiding inside every human, manifesting at various degrees. The push to do something new and special overflows from everyone given the conducive environment. When that push bursts out from within, neither money nor ego nor anything else can even come near it, let alone constrain it.</p><p align=\"justify\">So, my conclusion is that we humans do what we are doing because <strong><em>we just can\'t help it</em></strong>. The knowledge/creativity/energy inside is trying to breakfree from all the limitations around. It is just the degree of manifestation that causes the differences between man and man.</p>', '2008-10-30 12:54:33')[0m

Don\'t be too shocked! - the title is misleading. ok.. let me explain.<br /><br />I was trying out the interfacing of ruby with other languages like C/C++, Java etc and wanted an example. So, I downloaded the C API (<a href=\"http://libyahoo2.sourceforge.net/\">libyahoo2</a>) for yahoo messenger with the idea of writing a wrapper for it in ruby. But I somehow couldn\'t get it working even after trying for almost a week after which I was too frustrated and gave up that idea. In the process, I looked at the C source code and ...hey! I said. Why not...? yes! you guessed it right! It looked as though I could write it in ruby itself from scratch!<br /><br />I started off soon. Now, Yahoo has its own packet strcture to manage communication between its client and server. Or, can you say its own <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html\">Domain specific language</a> in a very crude sense? whatever. I tried to build that packet structure but with no success. The yahoo server doesn\'t respond at all if the packet is not proper i.e. it doesn\'t say that I am wrong. This situation looked as though I was trying to communicate with an extra-terrestrial entity in its own language!<br />It was indeed a very tricky situation.<br /></div><ul><li><div align=\"justify\">You don\'t have tests to tell you what to expect out of your code.</div></li><li><div align=\"justify\">You don\'t know how near you are or how far you are to the solution until you actually get the right solution. </div></li></ul><div align=\"justify\">But finally! after doing a little bit of trial and error and wishful thinking and all that, it <em>actually talked</em> to me! It started sending me the buddy lists, cookies and lots of things.<br /><br />After that it was all normal. I generalised the packet generation and cleaned up my code. Right now I just have made of it a sort of API which can be used to write any sort of client. I have written a small CLI client with just the basic functionality of logging in and sending/receiving messages and typing notifications. Now I am thinking of writing a web-based client using <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org\">ruby on rails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php\">AJAX</a>.<br /><br />This was quite a useful experiment for me. It made me comfortable with ruby. I learnt a lot about how yahoo messenger works and in general how such asynchronous messaging works. I also recollected socket programming and multi-threaded programming and reading C code ;-).</div>', '2008-10-30 12:54:33')[0m

He traced the evolution of the enterprise industry and approaches to enterprise integration, while pointing out interesting observations on how technologies can end up creating more problems than solving it if \"developer convenience\" is prioritised over \"correctness\" of the solution.<br />This was followed by an interesting talk by <a href=\"http://www.erlang-exchange.com/klacke-wikstrom\">Klacke Wikström</a>, about erlang and tail-f systems.<br />After this, there were three parallel tracks for the rest of the day, with a few tutorial sessions.<br /><br /><span>The Enterprise Integration track</span> included talks about <a href=\"http://www.rabbitmq.com/\">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ejabberd.im/\">EJabberD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/index.html\">JInterface</a>, <a href=\"http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/\">CouchDB</a>, etc.<br /><br />There was also a very interesting session by <a href=\"http://www.zib.de/reinefeld\">Alexander Reinefeld</a> on \"Building a transactional distributed data store with Erlang\". Refer to the paper <a href=\"http://www.ist-selfman.org/wiki/images/b/bd/2008-05-scale-challenge.pdf\">here.</a> They have some amazing results on experiments conducted by hosting the entire Wikipedia on a p2p infrastructure, completely built with erlang which scales better with fractional hardware!

The other tutorials were about buiding web applications in erlang, using Faxien and Sinan, and about robotics.<br /><br />The conference concluded with a panel discussion on Erlang enterprise integration. Most people agreed with Joe\'s opinion that erlang needs a killer app to prove to the enterprise before it can be widely accepted. And the lack of libraries for lots of small things was also another reason which would put people off erlang.<br /><br />One thing that everyone in the room was convinced about was that erlang is going to definitely grow big in the coming future. And the erlang community, though quite small as of now, is quite mature and pragmatic in saying \"The right tool for the right Job\" - Using erlang gives tremendous results, only when used for the right things. And this pragmatism, I feel, is a very positive way to look at solving the problems in front of us.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very successful event, thanks to the organizers (<a href=\"http://skillsmatter.com/\">skillsmatter</a> and <a href=\"http://erlang-consulting.com/\">erlang training and consulting</a>) , sponsors, speakers and participants.

The approach of building individual monolithic applications to solve enterprise problems has evolved into an approach of dividing the problem into smaller ones, coming up with different solutions for those and finally having an integration mechanism in place which puts everything together.<br /><br />This approach not only simplifies the problem at hand, but also makes evolution of software easier and reduces the \"single point of failure\" problem with monolithic apps.<br />Well...the valididy of the above statement depends on the way it is done. This approach can lead to probably bigger problems if enough care is not taken at the right times.<br /><br />Talking about the integration bit, there are various approaches to choose from. And <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" class=\"externalLink\">these </a> are the most common ones. File Transfer, Shared Database, Some form of Messaging, etc. Of course, as always, each approach has its pros and cons, but largely, here are my notes on why i feel that the shared database approach seems lika a bad idea.<br /><br />Multiple applications accessing the same database is quite analogous to the shared memory way of implementing concurrent access of data (Consider each application as a thread and all threads accessing a shared data structure which is the database in this case). The shared memory approach comes along with its set of patterns and best practices to be applied for a successful implementation -<br /><ul><li>have as minimal shared data as possible<br /></li><li>synchronizing access to the shared data structure<br /></li><li>not having <i>copies</i> of that shared data in multiple threads<br /></li><li>do as little as possible in the synchronized block (i.e. when the lock has been acquired)<br />-probably just do the actual update of the data and free the lock. No thread should hold the lock for long periods.<br /></li></ul>More details could be found <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/~rsilvafi/papers/FormalMethodsFinalPaper.pdf\" href=\"http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/%7Ersilvafi/papers/FormalMethodsFinalPaper.pdf\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a> (Warning: PDF file)<br /><br />The shared database EAI approach will also involve taking corresponding equivalent precautions, Which in a lot of cases, is tough to achieve. All applications will be talking to the same set of tables - minimizing shared data in this case means restricting use of certain tables by only specific apps and so on - which leaves us with few tables which are used as a communication medium between apps. And again this, over a period of time, tends to spill over and might end up in a situation where apps start talking to unrelated tables.<br /><br />Another common pattern seen in such apps is that the database ends up being used as a queue - filled up by one app and consumed by another.<br /><br />Caching data in the applications takes a serious hit as the data might get stale more often than not. Performance, being the main reason behind caching, goes for a toss too. This is corresponding to the \"not having <i>copies</i> of that shared data in multiple threads\" as mentioned above. Caching it is infact keeping a copy of the global data which might change without notice. What might end up happening is that version checks are done every now and then, or atleast on updates on all tables.<br /><br />Taking a step backward, there are questions about the shared memory way of implementing threads itself.<br /><i>In highly concurrent programs</i>, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_language\" class=\"externalLink\">languages</a> like <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://erlang.org/\" href=\"http://erlang.org/\" class=\"externalLink\">Erlang</a> are preferred over others which provide a shared memory based solution. This is tending towards the messaging approach which erlang uses and hence totally avoids shared data. Again, it depends. Probably a combination of both might be the best solution in some cases as well.<br /><br />Taking one more step backward, looking at this approach in an abstract sense, it can be seen that the data would not encapsulated. All applications have access to all data. It just doesn\'t look like the right way of doing it, unless there are enough justifications for it. It looks similar to having global variables in the code (Which is also avoided as far as possible).<br /><br />Rather, consider that each application talks to its own database (which holds just enough data which only this app concerns itself with) and the different apps communicate by sending messages to each other(which is close to an SOA architecture). A common objection to this approach is: There is a lot of data to be sent across to another application. If XML is used, serialization and deserialization itself becomes an overhead etc etc.<br /><br />My answer to that would probably be: The very fact that a lot of data has to be sent is probably indicating that the responsibilities of the applications should be refined. Maybe there is another application in the middle. Maybe some of the operations exist elsewhere.<br />The crux of the problem is in effectively identifying and conceptualising the applications (or services), just as identifying and conceptualising objects is vital for OO.<br /><br />However, a few good articles about EAI approaches are <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=169483&seqNum=1&amp;rl=1\" href=\"http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=169483&seqNum=1&amp;rl=1\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/IntegrationStylesIntro.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/IntegrationStylesIntro.html\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"External link to http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" href=\"http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Introduction.html\" class=\"externalLink\">here</a>', '2008-10-30 12:54:34')[0m

We at <a href=\"http://blog.bumsonthesaddle.com/\">BOTS</a> have been wanting to slowly start improving the bicycle amenities in the city.&nbsp; Bicycle lanes, bicycle parking lots, safety awareness for bikers, simple products that can make your life easier etc etc. Some are in the pipe line and some have been gathering dust, due to lack of time, not interest.<br /><br />Recently CNN IBN got in touch with us and asked us to take up one activity related to biking and take it thru in a span of 4 weeks for some programme of theirs. We were extremely hesitant as we were swamped with work and all these short term thingies really dont work out. But then there was another group in Bangalore which was enthu about this too. Formerly called <b>A.I.R</b>, now renamed <b>Go Cycle. </b>We met up a few times and decided that parking lots for cycles was something that could be addressed.<br /><br />So here goes. We are going to introduce bicycle parking lots in 3 places in the city and see how it holds and then introduce them all over the city. Hopefully. So stuff to do<br />- identify locations for the parking lots<br />- design the stand<br />- figure out funding<br />- execute it<br /><br />One <b>place that we identified</b> was outside Lalbagh. Its a shame to see 100s of folks who ride/drive up till lal bagh. Walk inside and then drive back. Seems utterly pointless. Atleast 10 of these could be converted to biking till there and then biking back home. There were a few other locations.<br /><br />- <b>design the stand.</b> We are asking some person to design it. But it would be really nice if interested people could take a stab at it and see if they could come up with something interesting. I want to design some really nice posters on this and see if we can have some kind of bicycle parking lot design contest (<i>lack of time is a problem here</i>). Should be a lot of fun.<br /><br />- <b>funding and execution.</b> Seems far away !<br /><br />Overall pretty exciting. Parking is an issue right now. <br />Only problem is time.', '2008-10-30 12:54:35')[0m

Till date whatever we know about bikes was self learned - by experimenting, making mistakes and reading from books and the internet, which is a kinda slow process.<br /><br />For the first time we met guys, technical guys from Trek who have been doing this for over 30 years, who really loved their bikes and it showed ! The time that we spent with them was brilliant. They knew what they were speaking about and even better, understood why they were doing it. And they rode bikes ( <i>sarcasm, but important</i> :) ).<br /><br />Kinda makes me understand why the age old tradition of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurukul\">Gurukul</a> was so awesome. If you are really interested in something you might not be able to learn it by just attending a session or two. You got to live the path and a fast track way would be to stay and work with a person who is substantially better than you in that field.<br /><br />The little time that we spent with these guys gave us an insight into the way Trek works. Apparently these guys go around the world taking dealers through what Trek stands for, what their bikes are capable of and the kind of research thats happening in this field. <br /><br />Awesome stuff.', '2008-10-30 12:54:35')[0m
